## Project Catechism: Integrated Soft Matter and Autonomous Systems

### 1. Project Vision and Alignment with KarmaGAP

**Problem Statement:**
The project addresses the gap in integrating soft matter physics with autonomous systems to create intelligent, adaptive materials and systems. This aligns with KarmaGAP's mission of promoting equity, sustainability, and community-driven progress by developing innovative solutions that can benefit various communities.

**Long-term Aspirations:**
The project aims to develop sustainable, intelligent soft matter systems that can adapt to different environments, enhancing applications in biomedical research, environmental monitoring, and smart materials. This initiative embodies KarmaGAP values by promoting inclusion through interdisciplinary collaboration, innovation through the integration of advanced technologies, and impact by addressing real-world challenges.

**Specific Gaps:**
The project closes the gap between soft matter physics and autonomous systems by developing new methodologies and tools that combine the strengths of both fields.

## 2. Understanding the Context

**Socio-Economic and Cultural Landscape:**
The project operates in a landscape where there is a growing need for sustainable and intelligent materials in various sectors, including healthcare, environment, and technology. The target communities include researchers, industries, and end-users who can benefit from these innovations.

**Systemic Barriers:**
Historical barriers include the lack of integration between soft matter physics and autonomous systems, limited understanding of how to scale up laboratory findings to industrial applications, and the need for more sustainable and equitable distribution of benefits.

**Existing Efforts:**
Existing efforts in soft matter physics and autonomous systems are often siloed. This project learns from initiatives like the soft matter physics group at Syracuse University[1] and the Division of Soft Matter (DSOFT) of the American Physical Society[2], while integrating autonomous systems expertise from Rupesh Mahore’s work.
