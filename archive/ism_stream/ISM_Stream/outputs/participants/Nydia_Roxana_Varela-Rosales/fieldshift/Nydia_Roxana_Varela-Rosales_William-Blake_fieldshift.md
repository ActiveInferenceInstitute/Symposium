## LEARNING FROM THE DOMAIN

### Key Concepts and Methodologies to Acquire
- **Understanding of Romanticism and Its Impact**: Varela-Rosales can benefit from learning about the Romantic movement, its emphasis on individual imagination, and how it influenced Blake's work. This includes understanding the rejection of Neoclassical and Enlightenment values[2][5].
- **Symbolism and Mythology**: Blake's use of symbolic characters (e.g., Los, Urizen, Orc) and mythological narratives is crucial. Learning about these symbols and their roles in his mythology can provide insights into his philosophical and artistic approaches[2][5].
- **Artistic Techniques**: Familiarity with Blake's innovative techniques such as relief etching, illuminated printing, and the use of watercolors and tempera can offer a deeper understanding of his artistic process. This includes learning about his rejection of oil painting and his preference for medieval painting techniques[1][3][5].
- **Spiritual and Philosophical Frameworks**: Blake's spiritual beliefs, including his rejection of organized religion and his emphasis on personal visionary experiences, are central to his work. Understanding these frameworks can help Varela-Rosales appreciate the deeper meanings behind Blake's art and poetry[2][4][5].

### Relevant Theoretical Frameworks
- **Imagination vs. Reason**: Blake's critique of Enlightenment rationalism and his championing of imagination are key theoretical frameworks. Understanding this dichotomy can help Varela-Rosales see how Blake's ideas intersect with broader philosophical debates[2][5].
- **Concept of Contraries**: Blake's concept of "contraries" and the unity of opposites is a foundational aspect of his philosophy. This framework can provide insights into how Blake viewed human nature and the universe[2][5].

### Technical Skills to Develop
- While Varela-Rosales's technical skills are rooted in materials science, learning basic artistic techniques or understanding the technical aspects of Blake's art (e.g., relief etching, watercolor) could enhance her appreciation and analysis of his work.
