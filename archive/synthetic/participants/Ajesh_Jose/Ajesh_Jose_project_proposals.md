### Project Catechism Aligned with EU Grant Requirements

**1. Project Rationale and Objectives**

* **Societal Problem:**  Environmental pollution, especially by persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and heavy metals, poses a significant threat to human health and ecosystem sustainability.  Current remediation methods are often expensive, energy-intensive, and may generate harmful byproducts.
* **Relevance:** The increasing severity of pollution coupled with the growing demand for sustainable solutions makes this problem highly relevant. The EUâ€™s Green Deal emphasizes the need for innovative technologies to restore polluted ecosystems.
* **Project Vision:** To develop a new generation of intelligent soft materials capable of autonomously targeting and degrading environmental pollutants.
* **Objectives:**
    * Design and synthesize stimuli-responsive polymers capable of incorporating plasmonic nanoparticles and hosting and controlling bacterial growth.
    * Engineer plasmonic nanoparticles for enhanced photocatalytic degradation of specific pollutants.
    * Develop a chemotactic mechanism that directs the soft material towards pollutant sources.
    * Demonstrate the efficacy of the bioremediation system in a controlled lab environment.
* **Measurable Impacts:**
    * Reduction in target pollutant concentration in contaminated water samples.
    *  Improved efficiency and reduced energy consumption compared to current bioremediation methods.
    * Development of a scalable and adaptable platform technology.
* **Contribution to EU Policies:**
    * Directly aligns with the Green Deal by providing a sustainable solution for environmental remediation. 
    * Fosters innovation and competitiveness in the field of advanced materials and biotechnologies.
 * **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
     * Percentage reduction of target pollutants in lab-scale trials.
     * Efficiency of photocatalytic degradation in controlled experiments.
     * Speed and accuracy of chemotactic targeting in defined environments.
     *  Scalability and production costs of the developed soft material.
     * Assessment of environmental impact (life cycle analysis).

**2. State of the Art and Novelty**

* **Current State of the Art:** Current bioremediation methods often involve directly introducing bacteria into contaminated sites. However, their efficacy is limited due to factors like nutrient availability, bacterial dispersal, and competition with native microbes. Plasmonic photocatalysis offers an alternative approach, but targeted delivery and control of the catalytic activity remain challenging. 
* **Gaps and Limitations:** Current solutions lack the ability to autonomously target pollutants and adapt to varying environmental conditions.  
* **Proposed Advancement:** This project introduces a novel solution combining the strengths of bioremediation (bacterial degradation) and plasmonic photocatalysis through a chemotactic intelligent soft material. This combines:
    * **Stimulus-responsive polymers:**  Provides a platform for harboring bacteria and nanoparticles and responds to chemical cues to guide movement.
    * **Plasmonic nanoparticles**: Enhance the degradation of pollutants through photocatalysis.  
    * **Bacterial swarm intelligence**: Guides  movement towards pollutants using chemotaxis.
* **Unique Selling Points:**
     * **Autonomous targeting:**  The chemotactic mechanism ensures focused action and avoids indiscriminate spreading of bacteria. 
     * **Dual degradation:** Combines bacterial and photocatalytic degradation to tackle different classes of pollutants.
     * **Adaptability**:  Stimulus-responsive nature allows for adjustment to varying environmental conditions.
* **Cutting-Edge Research:** This project  integrates advancements in active matter (chemotaxis), nanotechnology (plasmonics), and materials science (stimuli-responsive polymers). This combination represents a novel and interdisciplinary approach within the EU research framework.
