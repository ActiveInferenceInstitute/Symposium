### 2. Problem Statement

**What is the root cause of the issue the project addresses?** 

The root cause is the limitations of conventional soft actuator designs, which typically rely on pneumatic or hydraulic systems that are prone to leakage and damage. Additionally, most soft robots are made from materials that lack self-healing ability, making them vulnerable to wear and tear.

- **Systemic Challenges**: The current soft robotics field heavily relies on actuation mechanisms borrowed from traditional rigid robotics. This systemic issue hinders the full potential of soft robots.
- **Structural Challenges**: The inherent fragility of most soft materials, coupled with the lack of efficient self-repair mechanisms, significantly reduces their lifespan and limits them to controlled environments. 
- **Behavioral Challenges**:  Current soft robots generally lack the ability to sense damage and adapt their behavior accordingly. This limits their autonomous operation in dynamic and unpredictable environments.

**What evidence supports the importance of addressing this issue?**

- **Data**: Numerous studies document the vulnerability of current soft robotics to damage and the difficulty of repairing soft materials. The lack of robust soft actuators hinders the progress of soft robotics research and its transition to real-world applications.
- **Case Studies:**  Reviewing past attempts to deploy soft robots in real-world scenarios often highlights the limitations related to their fragility. Failed deployments in disaster relief and exploration underscore the critical need for more robust and self-reliant soft robots. 
- **Historical Trends:** The historical progression of robotics shows a shift from rigid, inflexible robots to soft, adaptable systems. However, achieving true intelligence and autonomy in soft robots n√©cessite a radical reimagining of materials and actuators. The lack of a successful solution for self-healing and adaptable soft actuation is a glaring gap that needs to be addressed.
- **Risks of Inaction:**  Failing to address these challenges will hinder the progress of soft robotics, limiting its potential transformative impact in various applications. The continued reliance on fragile materials and inefficient actuators will constrain the development of intelligent soft robots that could revolutionize fields like healthcare, manufacturing, and exploration.
