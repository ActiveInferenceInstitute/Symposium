# Project Proposals: Giulia Janzen

## Project Title:  Emergent Cognition in Programmable Soft Matter for Adaptive Drug Delivery

### 1.  Project Rationale and Objectives

**Societal problem & relevance:**  The efficient and targeted delivery of drugs to specific sites in the human body remains a significant challenge in medicine. Traditional drug delivery often leads to off-target effects, reducing efficacy and increasing side effects. The development of intelligent soft materials capable of autonomously adapting their behaviour and responding to biological signals could revolutionize personalized medicine by improving drug delivery precision, reducing side-effects, and enhancing therapeutic outcomes.

**Alignment with EU call for proposals:**  This project directly addresses the call for proposals focused on developing innovative solutions within the domain of Intelligent Soft Matter. It specifically targets the intersection of bio-inspired materials, machine learning, and autonomous therapeutic systems, utilizing fundamental principles of active matter and stimuli-responsive materials.

**Vision and Impact:**

The project envisions a future where soft materials can act as "intelligent" drug delivery vehicles, capable of navigating the body, sensing specific biological signals, and releasing drugs only at the intended target sites. This vision will be realized through the development of biocompatible soft materials with embedded cognition-like functions, demonstrating a clear breakthrough in adaptive drug delivery.

**Measurable impacts:**

* Successfully demonstrate the proof-of-concept for an autonomous soft matter drug delivery system in both simulated and in vitro environments, demonstrating adaptability and target recognition.
* Publish at least 5 high-impact peer-reviewed publications in leading scientific journals within the field of Intelligent Soft Matter.
*  File at least one patent for the novel design and functionalities of the intelligent soft matter drug delivery system.
*  Establish an interdisciplinary consortium of European research groups, fostering collaboration and knowledge transfer in the field of intelligent soft matter. 

**Contribution to EU policy priorities:**

This project aligns with EU policy priorities, such as the European Green Deal, by emphasizing the design of eco-friendly and biocompatible materials. Additionally, it contributes to the EU's focus on digital transformation by leveraging machine learning and advanced computational tools for designing and controlling soft matter behavior. The project also promotes social inclusion by targeting innovative therapies that will lead to improving healthcare and societal well-being. 

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

* **Success rate of targeted drug delivery** in lab-scale experiments using in vitro disease models.
* **Reduction in off-target drug accumulation** compared to traditional drug delivery methods.
* **Demonstrated adaptability of the system** to different simulated biological environments.
* **Number of publications and patents** generated during the project.

### 2. State of the Art and Novelty

**Current state of the art:** Existing drug delivery systems are primarily passive, relying on diffusion or pre-programmed release mechanisms. These systems lack the ability to adapt and respond to the dynamic environment within the body, leading to suboptimal outcomes.  While recent advances in stimuli-responsive polymers offer some adaptability, their functionalities are limited. 

**Addressing gaps & limitations:**

*  Passive diffusion leads to off-target drug accumulation and potential side-effects.
*   Pre-programmed systems lack the capacity to dynamically adapt to individual patient needs and changing biological conditions.

**Novel Approach & USPs:**

The project adopts a **Research Domain Field Shift** strategy by drawing inspiration from the **collective behavior of social insects**. It will create a decentralized system where microscopic soft matter "agents" (drug-loaded microgels) function as an artificial "swarm". These agents, possessing limited individual intelligence, will communicate and collaborate to achieve targeted delivery:

* **Collective Intelligence:**   Mimicking swarm intelligence, each microgel agent will be equipped with simple sensors and actuators based on stimuli–responsive polymers. This allows them to respond to localized cues (e.g., pH, temperature, specific biomarkers) and communicate through local interactions.
* **Machine Learning for Global Control:** A machine learning framework will analyze real-time data from sensors embedded within the material, allowing the system to learn and adapt to the changing environment within the human body.  This global control system mimics the "pheromone communication" found in insect colonies, enabling the swarm to optimize drug release at target locations while minimizing off-target effects.

**Distinguishing Features:** 

* **Decentralized Control:** Unlike conventional DDS, which rely on external control, this system self-organizes, maximizing efficiency and adaptability.
* **Bio-Inspired Design:** The swarm intelligence paradigm offers inherent robustness, as individual agent failure doesn’t jeopardize overall functionality. This bio-inspired design provides a unique approach to distributed sensing, processing, and actuation within the human body.
* **Enhanced Efficiency and Precision:** The project aims for a transformative impact, pushing beyond the limitations of current DDS by integrating bioinspired design principles with advanced material science and machine learning.
