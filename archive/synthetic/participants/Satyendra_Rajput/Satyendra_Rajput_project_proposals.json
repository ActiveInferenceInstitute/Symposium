Societal Problem and Relevance:**\n\nChronic wounds represent a significant and growing societal burden, affecting millions of individuals across the EU and globally. These wounds, often associated with diabetes, vascular disease, and aging populations, lead to prolonged suffering, reduced quality of life, and significant healthcare costs.  Traditional treatments for chronic wounds are often ineffective, and the development of new therapeutic approaches that promote rapid and efficient healing is critically needed. \n\nThis project is highly relevant now due to:\n\n* **Increasing prevalence of chronic wounds:** As the EU population ages and the incidence of diabetes and other chronic diseases rises, the burden of chronic wounds continues to escalate, demanding novel and effective solutions.\n* **Limitations of current treatments:**  Existing therapies often rely on passive dressings or systemic medications, lacking precise targeting and control over the healing process. \n* **Emerging potential of bio-hybrid materials:** Advances in soft matter science, microfluidics, and synthetic biology enable creating bio-hybrid materials that combine synthetic elements with biological components, paving the way for more intelligent and adaptive treatment approaches.\n\n\n**1.2. Alignment with EU Call Objectives:**\n\nThis project aligns perfectly with the anticipated Horizon Europe call \"**Novel Biomaterials and Systems for Personalised Therapy**\", aiming to develop innovative therapeutic strategies based on advanced materials and engineering principles. The call specifically seeks projects that:\n\n*  Develop novel bio-inspired materials with enhanced functionality and bioactivity.\n*  Integrate biological components within synthetic systems for personalized therapeutic interventions.\n*  Showcase the potential for translational research with clear clinical and societal benefits.\n\n**1.3. Vision:**\n\nThe CROWDBOTS project envisions a paradigm shift in chronic wound treatment by developing  autonomous, bio-hybrid soft robots that actively promote tissue regeneration and accelerate healing.  This vision will be realized by leveraging Satyendra Rajput's expertise on molecular crowding to create bio-inspired soft robots that integrate living cells within a stimuli-responsive polymer matrix. \n\n**1.4. Measurable Impacts:**\n\nThe project aims to achieve the following measurable outcomes:\n\n* **Development of a functional CROWDBOT prototype:** Design and fabricate a bio-hybrid soft robot capable of autonomous movement within a wound environment.\n* **Demonstration of accelerated wound healing:** Preclinical studies evaluating the effectiveness of CROWDBOTS in promoting tissue regeneration and reducing healing time in animal models of chronic wounds.\n* **Successful technology transfer for clinical translation:** Secure patents for the CROWDBOT technology and engage in partnerships with biomedical companies to facilitate clinical trials and bring the therapy to the market.\n\n\n**1.5. EU Policy Priorities:**\n\nThis project directly contributes to multiple EU policy priorities:\n\n* **European Green Deal:**  CROWDBOTS aims to reduce the healthcare burden of chronic wounds, leading to fewer hospitalizations, reduced use of antibiotics, and a more sustainable healthcare system overall.\n* **Digital Transformation:** The intelligent soft matter technology underpinning CROWDBOTS will contribute to the advancement of digital healthcare in the EU, bringing personalized and autonomous therapeutic solutions to reality.\n\n\n**1.6. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**\n\n* **Successful fabrication of CROWDBOT prototypes with defined functionalities (movement, cell viability, biocompatibility).**\n* **Demonstration of increased healing rate (e.g., 50% reduction in healing time) in preclinical models compared to control groups.**\n* **Successful securing of at least 2 patents related to CROWDBOT technology and design.**\n* **Establishment of at least 1 partnership with a biomedical company for further development and clinical translation.**\n\n\n### 2.
