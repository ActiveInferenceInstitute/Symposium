**Core Design Principles (Concept Translation):**

* **Sensing**:   
    * Mimicking quorum sensing found in biofilms, the materials will incorporate biosensors specifically engineered to detect specific target pollutants. In this approach, the concentration of pollutants will act as the signal that triggers the aggregation of the material towards the source, similar to how bacteria aggregate in response to quorum sensing molecules. 
* **Communication**:  
    * Inspired by the communication pathways within biofilms, the engineered materials will utilize local chemical signaling to coordinate their movement and degradation activities, enabling a decentralized control strategy that resembles biofilm expansion and organization.  
* **Degradation**:  
    * Borrowing from the enzyme-mediated degradation strategies in biofilms, the materials will incorporate immobilized enzymes specifically targeted to degrade the detected pollutants. The enzymes will be selected and optimized to efficiently break down the pollutants into harmless byproducts.

**Material Design and Fabrication:**

* **Building Blocks:**  Maria Jose Esplandiu’s expertise in carbon nanotubes will be utilized to create a porous, biocompatible scaffold structure.  The high surface area of this scaffold will be ideal for immobilizing enzymes and sensors efficiently, mimicking the matrix structure of biofilms.
* **Stimuli-Responsive Polymers:**  Stimuli-responsive polymers (e.g., hydrogels with environmental responsiveness like pH) will be incorporated into the scaffold to enable dynamic changes in shape, permeability, and rigidity in response to local pollutant concentration, facilitating movement, aggregation, and optimized degradation. These will act analogously to the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that provide structure and adaptability to biofilms.
* **Bio-Component Integration:**  Ajesh Jose will contribute to the engineering and integration of biosensors and specific degradation enzymes, drawing on his understanding of bacterial systems. He will guide the design of customized biosensors that detect the target pollutant, using approaches such as DNAzyme-based sensors for a specific heavy metal or a genetically modified bacterial system for sensing specific xenobiotics. The enzymes would be chosen or engineered to efficiently
