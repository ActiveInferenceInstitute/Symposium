# Project Proposals: Maria Jose Esplandiu

## Project Title: Bio-Inspired Adaptive Soft Neuromorphic Sensors for Continuous Monitoring of Wound Healing

## 1. Vision and Scope

**What is the project’s overarching goal?**

The project aims to develop a new class of bio-inspired, adaptive soft sensors for continuous, autonomous monitoring of wound healing.  These sensors, built upon principles from both soft matter physics and bioelectronics, will revolutionize wound care by providing real-time information on the healing process, enabling early detection of complications, and offering personalized feedback for optimized treatment strategies. This project seeks to improve patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs associated with wound management, and contribute to the global challenge of improving wound care, particularly in resource-limited settings.

**Why is the project needed now?**

Chronic wounds affect millions worldwide, placing a substantial burden on healthcare systems.  Current methods for monitoring wound healing are often subjective, infrequent, and disruptive.  The need for continuous, objective, and non-invasive monitoring is pressing. This project directly addresses this need by leveraging the latest advancements in soft matter materials, bioelectronics, and machine learning. The project's timing aligns with the burgeoning field of intelligent soft matter and the increasing demand for personalized and data-driven healthcare solutions.

## 2. Problem Statement

**What is the root cause of the issue the project addresses?**

The current challenge lies in the limitations of existing wound monitoring techniques.  These techniques are often:

*  **Subjective:**  Visual assessment by clinicians can be prone to variability and inconsistency.
*  **Infrequent:** Periodic assessments fail to capture real-time changes in the wound environment.
*  **Disruptive:**  Frequent dressing changes for assessment can disrupt healing and cause patient discomfort.

These challenges are primarily **structural**, stemming from a lack of accessible technology for continuous and objective wound monitoring. 

**What evidence supports the importance of addressing this issue?**

Numerous studies highlight the high incidence of chronic wounds and the associated healthcare costs.  The World Health Organization estimates that chronic wounds affect over 2% of the population in developed countries.  Complications such as infections and delayed healing are common, leading to prolonged hospital stays, increased healthcare expenditures, and reduced patient quality of life.  Addressing the limitations in wound monitoring is crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing the overall societal and economic burden of chronic wounds.

## 3. Proposed Solution and Key Innovation

**What is the central idea or mechanism behind the project’s solution?**

The project proposes a novel solution:  **bio-inspired, adaptive soft neuromorphic sensors.** These sensors will comprise:

1.  **Nanomaterial-Based Sensing Elements:**  Maria Jose Esplandiu's expertise will focus on developing highly sensitive and selective sensors based on carbon nanotubes and surface functionalization techniques (from her research profile). These nanomaterials will detect crucial biomarkers related to wound healing, such as pH changes, inflammatory markers, and oxygen levels. 
2.  **Stimuli-Responsive Hydrogels:**  Achille Giacometti's expertise will be crucial in constructing a stimuli-responsive hydrogel matrix (from his research profile) that encapsulates the nanomaterial sensors and dynamically adapts to the wound environment. This hydrogel will mimic the extracellular matrix, allowing for optimal biocompatibility and providing a stable platform for continuous, long-term monitoring.
3.  **Neuromorphic Information Processing:**  Menachem Stern will contribute his expertise in physical neural networks (from his research profile) to design an electronic component within the sensor that mimics the learning and adaptive behaviors of biological neurons. This component will be fabricated on a flexible substrate and integrated into the hydrogel structure, allowing the sensor to interpret and adapt to the dynamic changes in biomarker signals, filtering irrelevant noise and enabling prediction of potential complications.

This unique combination of nanomaterials, soft matter, and neuromorphic computing creates a paradigm shift in wound monitoring.

**How does the solution improve upon or differ from existing approaches?**

The proposed solution is **transformative** for several reasons:

*  **Continuous Monitoring:**  The sensors provide real-time feedback on the wound environment, capturing dynamic changes missed by periodic assessments.
*  **Objective Data:**  The nanomaterial-based sensors deliver quantitative data, offering objective insights into the healing process.
*  **Non-Invasive:**  The soft and biocompatible nature of the sensor eliminates the need for disruptive dressing changes.
*  **Personalized Treatment:**  The neuromorphic processing capability allows for personalized feedback and adaptation of treatment strategies based on individual healing patterns.

This approach fills a critical gap in wound care by providing a technology that is continuous, objective, non-invasive, and personalized.
