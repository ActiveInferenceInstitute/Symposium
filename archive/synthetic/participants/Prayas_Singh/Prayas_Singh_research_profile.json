Research Focus:**\n\nPrayas Singh's research primarily focuses on the **structure, properties, and applications of soft matter systems**, specifically **lyotropic liquid crystals** derived from natural surfactants. This work spans  rheological behavior, antimicrobial activity, and investigations into the impact of different additives on the material properties. The research profile also demonstrates an interest in exploring the potential of incorporating nanomaterials like graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes into these soft matter systems for enhanced functionality. \n\n**2. Impact Analysis:**\n\nThe research profile indicates a moderate level of impact. While some publications show a promising number of citations (e.g., \"Studies on the surface and thermodynamic properties of some surfactants in aqueous and water+1,4-dioxane solutions\"), the overall citation count across the publications is relatively low. This might suggest that the research is still in the early stages of developing broader influence within the soft matter community. \n\n\n**3. Research Evolution:**\n\nPrayas Singh's research has evolved from foundational studies on the **fundamental properties of surfactants and lyotropic liquid crystals** to exploring their potential in areas like **antimicrobial applications and nanocomposite development.** This demonstrates a progression towards more applied research directions while maintaining a grounding in the core principles of surfactant self-assembly.
