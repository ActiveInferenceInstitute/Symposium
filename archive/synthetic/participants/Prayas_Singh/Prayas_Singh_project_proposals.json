Vision and Scope\n\n**What is the project’s overarching goal?** \n* The overarching goal of this project is to develop a novel biomimetic artificial neural network platformed on a dynamically reconfigurable network of lyotropic liquid crystals (LCs) doped with stimuli-responsive polymers and functionalized nanoparticles. This platform will integrate sensing, local information processing, and actuation capabilities within a single material, mimicking the function of biological neural networks. The project aims to demonstrate a fundamentally new approach to intelligent soft matter, capable of performing complex tasks traditionally associated with conventional computing systems.\n\n- **Global Impact:** This project aims to establish a new paradigm for designing intelligent soft matter, potentially revolutionizing fields like soft robotics, biomedical engineering, and energy harvesting. \n- **Societal & Scientific Challenges:** It addresses the fundamental challenges of designing materials with cognitive-like functionalities, particularly in replicating the parallel and distributed processing power of biological brains.\n- **Distinguishing Features:** This project brings together several novel concepts: (1) utilizing LCs for biomimetic neural network design, (2) incorporating dynamic reconfigurability through stimuli-responsive elements, (3) integrating localized information processing within the material. \n\n**Why is the project needed now?**\n* The field of intelligent soft matter is rapidly evolving, with demand for materials that go beyond static functions and exhibit adaptive behavior. Current approaches largely rely on traditional computational frameworks embedded within the material, which limit their potential for organic, distributed intelligence. This project is timely because:\n\n- **Pressing Issues:** It addresses the need for materials that can truly perceive and interact with their environment in a dynamic and autonomous fashion.\n- **Alignment with Trends:** The project aligns with the growing interest in bio-inspired computing, self-organizing materials, and unconventional approaches to information processing. \n\n\n### 2. Problem Statement\n\n**What is the root cause of the issue the project addresses?**\n* The limitations of current intelligent soft matter primarily stem from the reliance on centralized computational units and pre-programmed responses. This makes them inflexible and unable to truly adapt to unforeseen situations. \n\n- **Systemic/Structural Challenges:**  The lack of a material system that intrinsically integrates perception, computation, and actuation at a decentralized level, mimicking the distributed intelligence of biological neural networks.\n- **Real-World Manifestation:** This leads to soft matter systems lacking the capacity for organic learning, adaptation and decision-making in complex, dynamic environments.\n\n**What evidence supports the importance of addressing this issue?**\n* Current soft robots, despite notable advances, still rely on bulky external processing units, limiting their autonomy. In biomedicine, the development of truly adaptive smart implants or drug delivery systems is hindered by our limited ability to design materials that respond to dynamic biological cues intelligently.\n\n- **Data & Trends:**  The rapid growth of research in both soft matter and neuromorphic computing highlights the urgency to bridge the gap between these fields. The rising demand for more autonomous and intelligent systems across domains reinforces importance.\n- **Risks of Inaction:** Failing to explore novel approaches like this project will limit the potential impact of intelligent soft matter, inhibiting progress in key areas like robotics, biomedicine, and materials science.\n\n### 3. Proposed Solution and Key Innovation\n\n**What is the central idea or mechanism behind the project’s solution?**  \n* The project utilizes the unique properties of lyotropic liquid crystals to mimic neural networks:\n\n- **Neuronal Analogy:**  Individual LC domains will act as \"neurons,\" each with a distinct optical response controllable by stimuli-responsive polymers incorporated within the LC network.\n- **Synaptic Connections:** Functionalized nanoparticles (NPs) embedded at the interface of LC domains will act as \"synapses.\" NP properties will be tuned for stimuli-dependent conductivity, enabling signal transmission between LC domains. \n- **Dynamic Reconfiguration:** The network's architecture will be dynamic. Stimuli-responsive polymers, designed for photoactivation, will change conformation upon light stimulation, altering the arrangement of LC domains and effectively \"rewiring\" the network. \n- **Information Processing:**  Changes in the optical properties of LC domains, in response to stimuli and network reconfiguration, will be used to encode and process information, similar to the dynamic signaling within biological neural networks.\n\n**How does the solution improve upon or differ from existing approaches?**  \n* This project offers multiple breakthroughs:\n\n- **Gap in Knowledge:** It directly addresses the gap in replicating distributed intelligence within a material. \n- **Transformative Nature:**  Moving away from centralized, pre-programmed responses, this solution allows the material to organically adapt and evolve its computational structure based on interactions with the environment. \n- **Paradigm-Shift:** By mimicking biological neural networks at the material level, the project opens up capabilities beyond current intelligent soft matter, potentially leading to materials with true cognitive potential.\n\n\n### 4.

His expertise in bacterial interactions can also be helpful to inform the integration of bio-inspired functionalities within the network.\n- **Menachem Stern:**  Bringing expertise in physical neural networks and designing systems exhibiting learning behavior, Menachem Stern will contribute to the development of algorithms that translate the material's optical response into a computational framework.\n\n**How will the project create and sustain collaboration?**  \n* The project will utilize a highly collaborative model:\n\n- **Co-creation:** Regular meetings and joint workshops will facilitate idea exchange and co-creation of experimental designs.\n- **Partnerships:** Active engagement with research groups at partner institutions and potentially international collaborators will be fostered. \n- **Shared Data:** A centralized platform will facilitate the sharing of data, models, and findings, ensuring transparency and maximizing the collective effort.\n\n### 5.
