# Project Proposals: Neus Feliu 

## Project Title:  Bio-inspired Soft Neuromorphic Materials for Adaptive Drug Delivery

### 1. Vision and Scope

**What is the projectâ€™s overarching goal?**

The overarching goal of this project is to design and develop a new class of bio-inspired soft neuromorphic materials capable of autonomously sensing, processing, and responding to biochemical signals within the human body. These materials will act as intelligent drug delivery systems, dynamically adapting drug release based on real-time feedback, leading to significantly improved therapeutic outcomes for a wide range of chronic diseases.

* **On a global scale:** The project aims to revolutionize drug delivery by creating a platform for personalized and adaptive medicine, leading to better efficacy, reduced side effects, and improved patient outcomes for those suffering from various diseases. 
* **Societal and scientific challenge:** Current drug delivery systems often suffer from imprecise dosing, leading to suboptimal therapeutic effects and potential side effects. This project addresses this crucial challenge by introducing a new materials-based paradigm where the material itself acts as a responsive and intelligent agent.
* **Distinguishing features:** This initiative transcends traditional drug delivery approaches, relying solely on passive diffusion or external controls, by introducing a bio-inspired, neuromorphic material capable of autonomous decision-making based on real-time biochemical input.


**Why is the project needed now?**

* **Pressing Issues:**  The rising prevalence of chronic diseases necessitates a move towards more precise and personalized medicine. Traditional drug delivery approaches often fail to account for individual variations in response and exhibit a lack of real-time feedback.
* **Alignment with Trends:**  The convergence of nanotechnology, soft materials science, and AI presents a unique opportunity to create truly intelligent materials. This project capitalizes on this growing synergy to address a crucial challenge in the biomedical field.


### 2. Problem Statement

**What is the root cause of the issue the project addresses?**

The root cause is the inherent **limitations of current drug delivery systems** which are largely passive and pre-programmed.  This often results in:

* **Inaccurate Dosing:**  Fixed doses do not account for variations in metabolism or disease progression.
* **Lack of Adaptability:**  Inability to adjust drug release in response to changing conditions within the body.
* **Limited Therapeutic Effects:**  Suboptimal drug concentrations at the target site leading to reduced efficacy.
* **Increased Side Effects:**  Off-target drug accumulation leading to unwanted side effects. 

These challenges are both **systemic (lack of personalized approaches)** and **structural (limitations in material design)**.

**Evidence Supporting Urgency:**

* **Epidemiological Data:**  The increasing prevalence of chronic diseases like diabetes and cancer highlights the need for improved treatment strategies.
* **Clinical Trials:**  Many clinical trials demonstrate the limitations of current drug delivery approaches, particularly in achieving sustained therapeutic levels and minimizing side effects.
* **Pharmaceutical Costs:**  Inefficient drug delivery contributes to high healthcare costs due to repeated treatments, hospitalizations, and management of side effects.


### 3. Proposed Solution and Key Innovation

**The central idea** of the project is to develop a soft material that mimics the functions of biological neural networks to enable adaptive drug delivery. This involves:

* **Stimuli-Responsive Nanoparticles:**  Neus Feliu's expertise in designing nanoparticles for drug delivery will be leveraged to create nanoparticles that respond to specific biomarkers (e.g., inflammatory markers for a chronic disease) by releasing encapsulated drugs. These nanoparticles will be the "synaptic" elements of the material, capable of releasing drug molecules in response to specific biochemical signals.
* **Soft Matter Matrix with Embedded Network:**  Soft Matter Physicists/Chemists will design a polymer matrix with an embedded network of conductive pathways. Feliu's nanoparticles, acting as the "neurons," will be integrated into this matrix. The conductivity of the network will be modulated by the biomarkers present in the environment, mimicking signal processing in the brain.
* **Machine Learning Control System:** Computational Biologists/Machine Learning Experts will develop machine learning algorithms that process information from the nanoparticulate sensors and guide the release of therapeutic agents in a controlled manner. This will create an autonomous feedback loop, allowing for dynamic adjustment of drug dosage based on real-time biochemical information.


**This solution is transformative** because:

* **It integrates biological-inspired design with advanced materials and artificial intelligence.** 
* **It creates a platform for truly personalized and adaptive drug delivery.**
* **It has the potential to significantly improve therapeutic outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.**
