Vision and Scope\n\n**What is the project's overarching goal?**\n\nThe overarching goal of this project is to develop novel bio-inspired nanostructured surfaces that can autonomously adapt to varying environmental conditions to maximize water harvesting efficiency. We aim to create a paradigm shift in water harvesting technologies, enabling sustainable and decentralized water collection even in arid and water-stressed regions. \n\n- **Global impact:** This project addresses the global challenge of water scarcity, providing a sustainable solution for collecting water in regions facing drought and water stress.\n- **Connection to societal and environmental challenges:**  It directly addresses the urgent need for sustainable water resources, contributing to food security, public health, and economic development.\n- **Distinction from existing projects:** This project distinguishes itself by focusing on the dynamic adaptability of the material itself, drawing inspiration from biological systems that have evolved efficient water collection mechanisms. Unlike static water harvesting approaches, our technology aims to create a self-optimizing system responding to real-time environmental changes. \n\n**Why is the project needed now?**\n\nThe urgency of addressing water scarcity is undeniable. With increasing global population and climate change intensifying droughts, access to clean water is a critical challenge. \n\n- **Pressing issues:**  The project aims to solve the growing challenge of water scarcity by:\n    * Developing a new paradigm for water harvesting that is efficient, adaptable and scalable.\n    * Providing a decentralized solution that can be deployed in remote or underdeveloped regions lacking traditional water infrastructure.\n- **Timing and alignment:**  This project aligns with:\n    * Increasing focus on biomimicry and bio-inspired design for sustainable solutions.\n    * The growing interest in intelligent materials and adaptive technologies.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Problem Statement\n\n**What is the root cause of the issue the project addresses?**\n\nThe root cause of water scarcity is a complex interplay of factors, including:\n\n* **Systemic challenges:** Climate change, population growth, and overexploitation of water resources create a systemic imbalance between water supply and demand.\n* **Structural limitations:**  Inadequate water infrastructure, inefficient irrigation practices, and lack of access to clean water technologies exacerbate the issue of scarcity, particularly in developing regions.\n* **Behavioral factors:**  Unsustainable water usage patterns and a lack of awareness about water conservation contribute to the problem.\n\n**What evidence supports the importance of addressing this issue?**\n\nThe urgency of addressing water scarcity is supported by extensive evidence:\n\n* **Reliable data:** Reports from the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations (UN) highlight the growing concern of global water stress, predicting that over half of the world's population will experience water scarcity by 2025.\n* **Case studies:** Case studies from drought-stricken regions around the world demonstrate the devastating social and economic consequences of water shortage. \n* **Historical trends:** Declining water tables, shrinking glaciers, and increasingly frequent droughts reinforce the need for immediate action.\n* **Risks of inaction:** Failure to address water scarcity will result in:\n    * Increased poverty and hunger.\n    * Social and political unrest.\n    * Environmental degradation.\n    * A growing global health crisis.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Proposed Solution and Key Innovation\n\n**What is the central idea behind the project's solution?**\n\nOur project proposes the Research Domain Field Shift (RDFT) approach to design bio-inspired nanostructured surfaces for water harvesting.  This approach translates the principles of natural systems that efficiently collect water from their environment. We have identified Olivier Pierre-Louis (expert in surface science, wetting phenomena, super-hydrophobicity and surface engineering) and Elena Ivanova (expert in design and synthesis of functional materials, particularly bio-inspired superhydrophobic surfaces and nanocellulose-based composites) as the most suitable collaborators based on their expertise.\n\nThe central idea is to develop surfaces that can passively capture atmospheric water through condensation and actively transport the collected water droplets using a combination of bio-inspired design principles and stimuli-responsive materials.  \n\n* **Bio-Inspired Surface Design:** The surface design is inspired by the unique microstructures found on the Namib Desert beetle and pitcher plants, which utilize a combination of hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions to create directional water transport. The goal is to design materials with multi-scale structures on nano to micron scale that can exploit those principles and can be integrated with smart materials. Elena Ivanovaâ€™s expertise will be crucial in the design and fabrication of these novel structures. \n\n* **Stimulus-Responsive Polymers (SRP):** We will incorporate stimuli-responsive polymers into the surface structure. The choice of stimulus will depend on the specific environment (temperature fluctuations, humidity changes, or even sunlight). The SRPs will undergo reversible conformational changes in response to these stimuli, driving the movement of water droplets towards collection points on the surface. The understanding of polymer physics and the design of these smart components will come from the expertise of Olivier Pierre-Louis in this research.\n\n**Key Innovations:**\n\n* **Dynamic Adaptability:** The key innovation is the integration of SRPs to achieve dynamic adaptability, enabling the surface to automatically adjust its properties for optimal water harvesting in response to changing environmental conditions.\n* **Biomimicry:** Leveraging multiple bio-inspired design principles for both passive water capturing and active transport is a unique feature of the proposed approach.\n* **Scalability and Sustainability:** Utilizing readily available materials and fabrication techniques, including the use of nanocellulose from sustainable sources, ensures the scalability and environmental sustainability of the proposed technology.\n\n **How does the solution improve upon existing approaches?**\n\nThe proposed solution offers a significant improvement over existing water harvesting methods:\n\n* **Enhanced Efficiency:** This technology aims to surpass the limitations of static water harvesting approaches, exceeding their efficiency by dynamically adapting to the immediate environment.\n* **Decentralized Water Collection:** The solution enables decentralized and localized water collection, reducing reliance on centralized water infrastructure, allowing deployment in remote, off-grid locations with limited resources. \n* **Responsiveness:** The adaptation to real-time environmental cues ensures consistent water collection under changing conditions, a significant advantage in unpredictable climates.\n* **Sustainability:** The adoption of bio-inspired design and sustainable materials sets it apart from energy-intensive approaches like desalination.\n\n\n---\n\n### 4.
