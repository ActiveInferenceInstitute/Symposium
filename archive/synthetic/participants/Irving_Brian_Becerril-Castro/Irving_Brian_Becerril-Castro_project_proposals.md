The collaborators chosen for this project represent a strategic selection focused on achieving a breakthrough in intelligent soft matter by applying principles of **embodied machine learning**. This project involves directly implementing machine learning algorithms within the physical material of a soft robot, employing plasmonic nanostructures for processing and computation.  This concept of **embodied AI** represents a significant paradigm shift from traditional, disembodied AI.

The **Research Domain Field Shift (RDFS)** technique aims to leverage concepts from one domain (in this case, plasmonics) to create a novel solution in another (soft robotics with embedded intelligence). By applying RDFS, this project offers an innovative approach to solve a problem not effectively addressed before in the scientific literature.  


The specific collaborators and their contributions are as follows: 

1. **Irving Brian Becerril-Castro: (Plasmonics Expert)** Becerril-Castro's expertise in plasmonics, particularly with gold nanostars and MOF-based systems for sensing and catalysis, will be crucial in the design and synthesis of the plasmonic nano-circuitry. He will lead the effort in creating individual plasmonic components (logic gates, waveguides) and optimizing their optical properties for information processing within the material.  This is the *source domain* providing the fundamental building blocks of the intelligent system.

2. **Daniela Kraft (Stimuli-Responsive Materials Expert):** Kraft's expertise in colloidal self-assembly and the design of functional materials, particularly those with bio-inspired functionalities, will be essential in integrating the plasmonic components into a suitable soft materials matrix.  She will be involved in selecting the appropriate stimuli-responsive polymer (the *target domain*) that can host the plasmonic nano-circuitry and designing the material to allow for efficient integration and interaction with the plasmonic elements.

3. **Vladimir Baulin (Computational Soft Matter Expert):** Baulin's expertise in computational soft matter modeling, specifically with coarse-grained simulations and self-consistent field theory, will be instrumental in predicting the behavior of the hybrid materials, understanding the interplay between the plasmonics network and the surrounding polymer matrix, and optimizing the design for desired functionalities. He will contribute to developing a theoretical framework for describing the emergent properties of the combined system (the *shifted domain*). This is the crucial link between the two domains, as Baulin's theoretical expertise will bridge Kraft's work with Becerril-Castro's expertise, enabling the design of an intelligent composite material not seen before in scientific literature. 

4. **Martin van Hecke (Mechanical Metamaterials Expert):** Van Hecke's expertise in the design and analysis of mechanical metamaterials will contribute to designing the overall architecture of the robotic device, particularly how the soft, intelligent material will be utilized to achieve dynamic actuation. He will leverage his understanding of programmable materials to translate the computational outputs from the plasmonics network into mechanical action. Bringing in the established field of mechanical metamaterials allows for an innovative solution to a previously unaddressed challenge in integrating computation and actuation directly within soft matter. 

5. **Stephen Ebbens (Active Matter Expert):** Ebbens has a demonstrated expertise in the design and study of autonomous micro-swimmers.  His contribution will be focused on integrating his understanding of autonomous motion to guide the integration of the intelligent material into a functional robotic system.  His work will be crucial to move the project from a demonstration of embodied computing within soft matter to a real-world application with autonomous behavioral capabilities (the *application domain*), showcasing the potential for creating a new generation of soft robots that integrate computation and motion in a single material.


This multi-disciplinary team, with backgrounds ranging from plasmonics, soft matter, and robotics, will enable the project to successfully navigate the scientific and technological challenges associated with this groundbreaking project, ensuring the highest chance of success.

The combination of expertise in plasmonics, stimuli-responsive materials, computational modeling, and robotics is crucial in achieving a successful RDFS.
