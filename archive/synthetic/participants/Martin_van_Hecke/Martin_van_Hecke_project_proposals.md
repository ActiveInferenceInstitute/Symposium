### 2. State of the Art and Novelty

**2.1 Current State of the Art:** 

The field of materials science has witnessed significant advances in designing materials with pre-defined functionalities, such as shape-memory polymers, self-healing materials, and stimuli-responsive materials. However, these materials lack the autonomy to perceive their environment and respond to changes in a dynamic, intelligent manner. While research into "intelligent materials" is emerging, it primarily focuses on mimicking specific functionalities found in biological systems (e.g., self-repairing properties), without addressing the broader challenge of embedding true cognitive capabilities that enable materials to learn and make decisions based on experience. 


**2.2 Gaps and Limitations:**

Current approaches to designing intelligent materials fall short in several ways:

* **Lack of True Cognition:**  Existing research primarily mimics pre-defined responses triggered by stimuli, lacking the ability to learn, adapt, and exhibit complex decision-making.
* **Limited Integration of Multiple Functionalities:** Most research focuses on single specific functionalities like self-healing, without integrating multiple features such as perception, communication, and logic operations.
* **Reliance on External Computation:**  The existing paradigms rely on external computing platforms to processsensory inputs and direct the materials' responses, failing to achieve embedded cognition within the material itself.
* **Lack of Robust Theoretical Framework:**  There's no overarching theoretical framework to understand and model the interplay of information processing, energy dissipation, and emergent behaviour within soft matter systems.  
* **Limited Scalability**: Current fabrication methods for integrating multiple components and functionalities into intelligent materials are often complex and costly, hindering their scalability and broader adoption.


**2.3 Advancing Beyond the Current State of the Art:**

This project aims to overcome these limitations by utilizing a **bio-inspired approach that leverages the principles of self-organization, active inference, and emergent computation.** The project will:

* **Develop Novel Theoretical Frameworks:**  Drawing upon concepts from neuroscience, cognitive science, and statistical mechanics, the project will create new theoretical models to understand and predict how cognition-like functionalities can emerge within soft matter systems. 
* **Integrate Sensing, Memory, and Actuation:**  The project aims to develop materials that seamlessly integrate multiple functionalities. This involves linking sensory inputs (e.g., chemical gradients, mechanical strains) with internal memory mechanisms and physical actuation, all within a single material structure.
* **Embed Localized Decision-Making:**  The project will explore novel approaches to embed information processing and decision-making capabilities directly within the material, minimizing reliance on external computing power. This is achieved through developing unique architectures and fabrication techniques to create distributed computation networks. 
* **Explore the Interplay of Stochasticity and Cognition:** By focusing on the role of stochastic fluctuations and noise in soft matter, the project will investigate the potential of randomness to drive adaptive behavior and enhance the responsiveness of intelligent soft materials.

**2.4 Unique Selling Points (USPs):**

* **Bio-inspired foundation:** Mimicking cognitive functions by leveraging the inherent dynamics of soft matter and self-organization, enabling true emergent behavior.
