Personalized treatments, particularly for complex diseases like cancer, require a dynamic approach that adapts to the individual patient’s physiological conditions.
* **Relevance:**  The project addresses this issue by developing a novel bio-inspired soft matter neural network embedded within a drug delivery system. This network will enable the autonomous adaptation of drug release based on real-time sensory input from the patient's body, mimicking the sophisticated control mechanisms found in biological systems.
* **Vision:**  To create a paradigm shift in drug delivery, moving from static, pre-programmed systems to intelligent, adaptive DDS that personalize treatment and optimize therapeutic outcomes.
* **Objectives:**
    * **Objective 1:** Develop biocompatible nanoparticles functionalized with specific antibodies or aptamers for biomarker recognition.
    * **Objective 2:** Integrate these nanoparticles with stimuli-responsive polymers to form a network structure within a soft, implantable device.
    * **Objective 3:** Establish a communication system within the network based on wave propagation triggered by the nanoparticles upon biomarker detection. 
    * **Objective 4:** Design the responsive polymer matrix to release the encapsulated drug at a rate proportional to the wave intensity, thus achieving dynamic drug dosage control.
    * **Objective 5:** Validate the system's efficacy and biocompatibility in in vitro and in vivo models.
