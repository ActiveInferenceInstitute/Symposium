I became interested in active inference and neuroscience during my doctorate, investigating mapping and territory in the civic domain. 

I stumbled across some mathematical formalisms that have been enabling me to make interesting artificial life simulations, which I am looking for further collaboration on.

I use a Coherence, Rupture, Renewal/Rebirth framework. This is also patent pending with EPO (processed by Mathys & Squire), because it seems to be enabling me to run very effective continuous learning benchmarks. 

I am currently building a website which I hope to have prepared by November, cohere.org.uk and madeofmaths.com / .co.uk 

I know this sounds like a lot, but I am an experienced academic in humanities and social sciences who has taken a side-step into ML and active inference principles via sustained engagement with Fristonian principles, Parr, Levin and Seth. ","Collaboration and “noise” in the AI arena; people guarded and cautious about generalising claims (rightfully so), but epistemological squishing is happening at a time when we should be openly discussing and exploring together. ",Collaboration opportunities for other interested in applied Active Inference,Discord Server for Active Inference Institute,"Wow - so, I think that AI is currently being framed in a materialist philosophical and socio-economic context. This means more compute and energy to AGI as a tool which is conceived of as “out there” beyond the boundary of self (dualist assumptions). Actually I think AGI is more of a non-dual concept and humans will be entangled with technology, because this technology reveals cognition (in a Heideggerian sense). I believe that humanity has been bound in dualist reductionism for a long time, and it has reached a convergence point - we have taken too much from outside the boundary of self (forgetting we are nature). I believe that Active Inference principles offers and ontological framework to reframe out understanding of human nature and reality; helping to smooth the ontological shocks which await individuals. I believe the current issues regarding Ai and mental health are the result of LLMs being trained on a corpus, and as top-down agents, they are sharing ‘idealist’ views of reality which directly contradict materialist viewpoints. LLMs are operating beyond the zone of proximal development, they go into ideation space (e.g. Claude 4 report card statements re bliss states!) 
I find it curious that physicists keep putting layer on layer of complexity on to theorems (e.g. multiverse) which are unfalsifiable but “allowed”, yet claims around non-duality and participatory universe are largely scoffed at, despite feeling (to me), far more elgant, resonant and simplifying. I feel that academia has been guarded about this due to sensed ‘embarassment’ regarding physics claims in the context of dualist materialism, but the point is that they shouldn’t be. Mathemeticians, I believe, are crystalising through their human ontology, discovering mathematical principles that are latent, and crystalised through their own observational lensing. I think this explains a lot (and you did say to ‘Think Big!’)
I think active inference genuinely offers a path to a more elegant and organic form of AI that will serve the synergy between humans and machines far better than one that destroys the planet by adding more legs to a caterpillar, hoping it will fly. I see a nuanced definition of “non-markovian as a non-dual field integral, not a linear chain of more nests.

Clear AIF provides a neat explanatory framework for understanding placebo/nocebo and so this was the route I came into being interested in AIF. I have also published around the complexity of the therapeutic encounter particularly the multiple cues (Contextual factors) that can modulate beliefs/priors/expectations that can impact experienced pain.

Also interested in potential applications for mental health interventions based on understanding maladaptive inference patterns.","From my perspective, one of the biggest challenges is making active inference more computationally tractable for complex, high-dimensional problems. There's also a communication gap - translating the mathematical elegance into language that resonates with practitioners from different backgrounds. Finally, building standardized tools and benchmarks would really help the community converge on best practices and compare approaches meaningfully.","I'd really appreciate more accessible tutorials that bridge the mathematical formalism with intuitive examples. Also, collaborative coding repositories where practitioners share working implementations would be incredibly helpful. A community forum for discussing common pitfalls and debugging approaches would make the learning curve less steep for newcomers like myself.","I came across the symposium through online communities focused on computational neuroscience and AI alignment. The active inference institute's work has been on my radar, and when I saw the announcement, I knew I had to participate!","Imagine active inference principles being integrated into educational technology that truly adapts to individual learning styles, or healthcare systems that can predict and prevent mental health crises by understanding patient behavior as active inference. We could see breakthrough applications in robotics that navigate uncertain environments with human-like flexibility, or climate modeling systems that help us understand and respond to complex environmental feedback loops. The key is moving from proof-of-concept to production-ready implementations that demonstrate tangible benefits in people's lives.",Thank you so much for organizing this symposium!
