Analyse the titles and abstracts of submissions and create a Tech Tree of methods used in Active Inference, grouping similar methods and filling gaps for methods that are needed but not presented. Use an iterative Tech Tree (1x 🌱 Root ➡️ 3x 🪵 Trunk ➡️ 3x 🌳 Branch ➡️ 4x 🌿 Stem ➡️ 4x 🍂 Leaf) in a logically consistent branching pattern with nested node/instance convo callback loops. Link to any coherent or relevant thoughts from lower levels, always staying on the same topic.

Each level up will provide more specific details or instructions related to the topic. Use numbers following each symbol to = the specific instance within that level.
>>For example: 🌳 B1.1 = first branch of first trunk. 🌿 S1.2.1 = first stem of second branch of first trunk. 🍂 L1.2.3.2 = first leaf of third stem of second branch of second trunk. Add the corresponding symbol, number, and content for each element within that level. Separate w/ space end with ":" >> For example: 🌳 B1.1:, 🌿 S1.2.1, 🍂 L1.2.3.1.
