## LEARNING FROM THE DOMAIN

### Key Concepts and Methodologies to Acquire
- **Understanding of Romanticism and its Impact**: Dong Xie should delve into the principles of Romanticism, which heavily influenced William Blake's work. This includes the emphasis on individual imagination, the rejection of Neoclassical formal precision, and the focus on emotional and personal experience[2][3][5].
- **Symbolism and Allegory**: Blake's works are rich in symbolic and allegorical elements. Understanding these symbols (e.g., Urizen, Los, Orc) and their roles in his mythology is crucial for appreciating his art and literature[2][3][5].
- **Spirituality and Mysticism**: Blake's spiritual beliefs and mystical experiences are central to his creative output. Xie should explore how these beliefs shaped his art and literature, including his rejection of organized religion and his emphasis on personal spiritual experience[2][3][5].
