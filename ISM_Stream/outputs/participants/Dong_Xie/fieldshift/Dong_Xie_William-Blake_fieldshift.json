This includes the emphasis on individual imagination, the rejection of Neoclassical formal precision, and the focus on emotional and personal experience[2][3][5].\n- **Symbolism and Allegory**: Blake's works are rich in symbolic and allegorical elements. Understanding these symbols (e.g., Urizen, Los, Orc) and their roles in his mythology is crucial for appreciating his art and literature[2][3][5].\n- **Spirituality and Mysticism**: Blake's spiritual beliefs and mystical experiences are central to his creative output. Xie should explore how these beliefs shaped his art and literature, including his rejection of organized religion and his emphasis on personal spiritual experience[2][3][5].\n- **Interdisciplinary Approaches**: Blake's work seamlessly integrates poetry, painting, and printmaking. Xie could benefit from understanding how to combine different artistic and literary forms to create a cohesive whole[1][3][5].\n\n### Relevant Theoretical Frameworks\n- **Blake's Concept of \"Contraries\"**: This concept, which emphasizes the coexistence of opposing forces in human experience, is pivotal in understanding Blake's philosophy. Xie should study how Blake explores duality in his works, such as in \"Songs of Innocence and of Experience\"[1][3][5].\n- **Imagination vs. Reason**: Blake's critique of Enlightenment rationalism and his championing of creative vision are key aspects of his work.
