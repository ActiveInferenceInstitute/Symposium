## Vision and Scope

### Project Title: Integrated Soft Matter and Polymer Physics for Adaptive Materials and Biomedical Applications

**Overarching Goal:**
The project aims to integrate the expertise of Daniela Kraft in soft matter physics, particularly self-assembly and lipid membrane dynamics, with Mithun Chowdhury's expertise in polymer physics and experimental techniques. The goal is to develop adaptive materials and biomedical devices that can respond to environmental stimuli, enhancing their functionality and efficiency.

**Why Now:**
