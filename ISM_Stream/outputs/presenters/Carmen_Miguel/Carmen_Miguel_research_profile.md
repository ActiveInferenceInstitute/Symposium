## Research Focus

### Main Research Areas and Expertise

The research profile of M. Carmen Miguel, a Full Professor of Condensed Matter Physics at the Universitat de Barcelona, is predominantly focused on several key areas within condensed matter physics and statistical physics.

- **Dislocation Dynamics and Plastic Deformation**: Miguel's work extensively explores the dynamics of dislocations in crystalline materials, including dislocation patterning, jamming, and the role of dislocation-dislocation correlations in plastic deformation[2][3].
- **Statistical Physics and Critical Phenomena**: Her research involves the application of statistical physics to understand phase transitions, critical phenomena, and the behavior of dislocation systems[2][3].
- **Collective Behavior and Complex Systems**: Miguel also investigates collective behavior in various systems, including flocking dynamics and the effects of heterogeneous social interactions on collective motion[4].

### Key Methodologies and Approaches

- **Simulations and Modeling**: Miguel employs numerical simulations, such as Monte Carlo models and dislocation-dynamics simulations, to study the behavior of dislocation systems and collective motion[2][3].
- **Experimental and Theoretical Analysis**: Her work combines experimental data, such as acoustic emission measurements, with theoretical models to understand complex phenomena like dislocation avalanches and plastic creep relaxation[2][3].
- **Statistical Analysis**: Statistical methods are used to analyze the dynamics of dislocation systems, including the study of avalanche correlations and triggering mechanisms.

### Notable Contributions to the Field

- **Dislocation Dynamics**: Miguel's research has significantly contributed to the understanding of dislocation dynamics, particularly in showing that dislocations move in a scale-free intermittent fashion and that dislocation avalanches follow a power-law distribution[2][3].
- **Collective Motion**: Her work on collective motion has highlighted the importance of network heterogeneity in maintaining ordered states in flocking models and the role of selective social interactions in schooling fish[4].
