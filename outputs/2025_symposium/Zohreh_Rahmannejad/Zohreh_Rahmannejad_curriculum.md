I notice that several key pieces of information about Zohreh Rahmannejad are missing from the profile. To create a truly personalized and effective curriculum, I'll need additional details about their:

1. Background (academic/professional experience)
2. Current Active Inference application interests
3. Specific learning needs
4. Current challenges
5. Pragmatic and epistemic goals

Would you be able to provide these details? This would help me design a curriculum that:
- Builds on their existing knowledge
- Addresses their specific challenges
- Aligns with their application interests
- Meets their learning style preferences
- Achieves their desired outcomes

In the meantime, I can suggest a preliminary assessment approach to gather this information:

**Initial Assessment Questions:**
1. What is your current familiarity with Active Inference?
2. What is your mathematical/computational background?
3. What field(s) do you plan to apply Active Inference to?
4. What are your immediate learning priorities?
5. How do you prefer to learn (e.g., theoretical, practical, mixed)?

Once you provide more details about Zohreh, I can create a fully customized curriculum that addresses their specific needs and goals. Would you like to share any of this additional information?
