I apologize, but I don't have enough information about Zohreh Rahmannejad's background, current work, or specific interests to provide a comprehensive profile analysis. Without concrete information about their research background, current projects, expertise level in Active Inference, and professional goals, I cannot make accurate assessments or recommendations.

3. Experience level with Active Inference
4. Specific goals for participating in the symposium
5. Technical skills and methodological expertise
6. Domain knowledge and area of specialization
7. Current challenges they're trying to address

If you could provide these details about Zohreh Rahmannejad, I would be happy to:

- Suggest research directions
- Recommend collaboration possibilities
- Develop a tailored symposium participation strategy
- Create a personalized development roadmap
- Propose Active Inference integration pathways

Please share any available information about the participant so I can offer a more detailed and accurate analysis.
