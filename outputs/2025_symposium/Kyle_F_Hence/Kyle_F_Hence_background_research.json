  "content": "After exhaustive multi-source web research, there is **no verifiable academic or professional information directly attributable to \"Kyle F. Hence,\" Founder of Regents (Regenerative Agents-focused AI), as an academic or Active Inference Symposium participant** in publicly accessible academic databases, institutional profiles, or common scholarly platforms (Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID, LinkedIn). The name and affiliation appear primarily in self-published or social media sources rather than in formal academic or scientific records.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Academic Background\n\n- **Educational history:** No records found in academic databases or institutional websites regarding degrees, graduation years, or formal education for Kyle F. Hence.\n- **Research areas and expertise:** Public self-reported background on [Medium](https://kylehence.medium.com/), [Substack](https://open.substack.com/pub/1stearth?r=bcv7s&utm_medium=ios), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gr8regeneration?s=21&t=kzMCFDFshy-dsb8lmiXUMw) indicate focus on regenerative AI, ecological and social regeneration, and systems thinking rather than formal academic research.\n- **Academic positions:** No verified academic or institutional affiliation beyond \"Founder, Regents\" found.\n- **Notable academic achievements, awards, grants:** No documented awards or grants in academia.\n- **Academic profile pages:** No Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID, or institutional academic profiles discovered.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Research Contributions\n\n- **Key publications:** No peer-reviewed journal articles, conference papers, or preprints under this name found in databases such as Google Scholar, arXiv, or institutional repositories.\n- **Research focus:** Based on self-published writings, interest lies in regenerative AI, socio-ecological systems, and agent-based models, but no formal publication record.\n- **Citation metrics:** Not available.\n- **Collaborative networks:** No academic co-authorship networks identified.\n- **Recent preprints:** None located.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Professional Experience\n\n- **Employment history:** Publicly available info shows Kyle F. Hence is the founder of a regenerative AI company, Regents, focused on regenerative agents and AI systems.\n- **Industry experience:** Emphasis on AI development and ecological regeneration, but no detailed employment history or consultancy publicly documented.\n- **Professional affiliations:** No memberships in professional scientific or AI organizations uncovered.\n- **Leadership roles:** Founder role at Regents confirmed via social media and self-published sources.\n- **Patents or applied work:** No verified patents or technical reports found.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Active Inference & Related Research\n\n- **Direct connections:** No formal publications or presentations directly linking Kyle F. Hence to active inference, free energy principle, computational neuroscience, or Bayesian inference found.\n- **Adjacent fields:** Self-reports suggest engagement with regenerative AI and systems approaches, which may conceptually overlap with active inference frameworks, but no explicit methodological publications or talks.\n- **Methodological overlap:** Potential theoretical alignment with agent-based modeling or Bayesian frameworks inferred from self-descriptions but not substantiated by academic work.\n- **Applications:** Proposed applications appear to be in AI agents for socio-ecological regeneration.\n- **Research gaps:** No documented research gaps or formal academic proposals.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Academic & Professional Network\n\n- **Collaborators:** No co-authored academic works or formal collaborations identified.\n- **Conference presentations:** No records of presentations at academic conferences or workshops.\n- **Community engagement:** Active in social media discussions and blogging on regenerative AI and systems thinking.\n- **Social media:** Active on Twitter at [@gr8regeneration](https://twitter.com/gr8regeneration?s=21&t=kzMCFDFshy-dsb8lmiXUMw) and posts on Medium and Substack.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Online Presence & Resources\n\n| Resource | Link |\n|----------|------|\n| Personal Medium blog | [kylehence.medium.com](https://kylehence.medium.com/) |\n| Substack newsletter | [1stearth Substack](https://open.substack.com/pub/1stearth?r=bcv7s&utm_medium=ios) |\n| Twitter profile | [@gr8regeneration](https://twitter.com/gr8regeneration?s=21&t=kzMCFDFshy-dsb8lmiXUMw) |\n| Company (Regents) | No official website found publicly |\n| Google Scholar | None found |\n| ResearchGate | None found |\n| LinkedIn | No verified profile found |\n\n---\n\n### 7. Future Potential & Opportunities\n\n- **Emerging research directions:** Based on self-published writings, focus is on regenerative AI agents and systemic transformation of socio-ecological systems.\n- **Opportunities for growth:** Potential exists to bridge theoretical active inference frameworks with regenerative AI applications, but formal academic grounding and peer-reviewed contributions are lacking.\n- **Potential impact:** Could contribute conceptual and applied insights to the field of active inference if research is formalized and peer-reviewed.\n- **Strategic collaborations:** No documented collaborations or partnerships with active inference researchers or labs, representing an opportunity for engagement.\n\n---\n\n### Notes on Research Limitations\n\n- The subject's name is uncommon, and multiple unrelated persons named Kyle with similar surnames appear in search results, but none match the founder of Regents or active inference symposium participant profile.\n- No ORCID or indexed academic profiles found, suggesting the individual is primarily an independent researcher or practitioner without formal academic credentials publicly listed.\n- Most information derives from self-published blogs and social media, which do not provide academic validation.\n\n---\n\n# References\n\n1.
