### Notes on Research Limitations

- The subject's name is uncommon, and multiple unrelated persons named Kyle with similar surnames appear in search results, but none match the founder of Regents or active inference symposium participant profile.
- No ORCID or indexed academic profiles found, suggesting the individual is primarily an independent researcher or practitioner without formal academic credentials publicly listed.
- Most information derives from self-published blogs and social media, which do not provide academic validation.
