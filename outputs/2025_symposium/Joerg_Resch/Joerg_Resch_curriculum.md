I notice that several key pieces of information about Joerg Resch are missing, which are crucial for creating a truly personalized curriculum. Before I can design a comprehensive learning path, I'll need to understand:

**Key Information Needed:**

1. **Background:**
- Academic/professional background
- Current field of work/research
- Prior experience with related concepts (e.g., Bayesian inference, cognitive science, computational modeling)
- Mathematical/programming proficiency

2. **Current Active Inference Application:**
- Specific domain or problem they're working on
- Current understanding/application of Active Inference
- Tools/frameworks they're currently using

3. **Learning Needs:**
- Specific aspects of Active Inference they want to master
- Immediate learning priorities
- Long-term learning goals

4. **Challenges:**
- Current obstacles in understanding/applying Active Inference
- Time constraints
- Technical limitations

5. **Pragmatic/Epistemic Value Sought:**
- Practical outcomes they hope to achieve
- Theoretical depth desired
- Specific applications they want to develop

Would you be able to provide these details about Joerg? This information would allow me to create a truly personalized curriculum that:
- Builds on existing knowledge
- Addresses specific gaps
- Aligns with learning goals
- Focuses on relevant applications
- Accounts for practical constraints

Once these details are provided, I can design a detailed, targeted curriculum following the structure you've outlined.
