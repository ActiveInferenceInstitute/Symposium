## Active Inference & Related Research

**Direct Connections to Active Inference**  
No publications, presentations, or projects directly related to active inference, free energy principle, Bayesian inference, or computational neuroscience were found. His stated interest in “Interoception & Biomechanics: A Biobehavioral Strategy” suggests a conceptual overlap with embodied cognition, but no formal research output in this area is documented[user-provided].

**Adjacent Fields**  
No evidence of work in free energy principle, Bayesian inference, or computational neuroscience found.

**Methodological Overlap**  
No evidence of modeling, simulation, or mathematical frameworks in his public work.

**Potential Applications**  
His expertise in posture, balance, and interoception could theoretically inform active inference models of embodied cognition, but no applied work or publications in this area are documented.

**Research Gaps**  
Given his clinical and educational focus, Weiniger may be positioned to bridge clinical practice with theoretical models of active inference in movement and posture, but there is no published work to substantiate this potential.

## Future Potential & Opportunities

**Emerging Research Directions**  
Weiniger’s stated interest in interoception and biomechanics suggests potential to contribute to active inference research on embodied cognition and sensorimotor integration, but no current publications or projects confirm this direction[user-provided].

**Opportunities for Growth**  
There is an opportunity to formalize his clinical insights into peer-reviewed research, collaborate with computational neuroscientists, and contribute to the growing field of active inference in movement science. However, no existing collaborations or foundational work in this area are documented.

**Potential Impact**  
If he transitions from clinical education to formal research, Weiniger could help bridge the gap between chiropractic practice and theoretical neuroscience, particularly in posture, balance, and interoceptive awareness.

**Strategic Collaboration Opportunities**  
Potential collaborators include researchers in computational neuroscience, biomechanics, and rehabilitation science, but no current partnerships are evident.

## Critical Limitations

- **No peer-reviewed publications** were found in academic databases, limiting the ability to assess research impact or collaboration networks.
- **Institutional affiliation** is claimed but not independently verified via University of Western States faculty listings.
- **Professional achievements** are self-reported and not corroborated by independent sources or press releases.
- **Active Inference involvement** is aspirational (course development) with no evidence of formal research contributions to date.
- **Online presence** is commercial/educational rather than academic, with no evidence of engagement in scholarly social media or code repositories.

**Conclusion**: Steven Weiniger, DC, is a seasoned chiropractic practitioner and educator with a strong focus on posture, balance, and interoception, and has developed significant online educational resources for professionals and the public. However, there is no verifiable evidence of formal academic research, peer-reviewed publications, or direct contributions to the field of active inference in the available public record. His potential to contribute to active inference research remains conceptual and aspirational, based on his stated interests and professional background[user-provided].
