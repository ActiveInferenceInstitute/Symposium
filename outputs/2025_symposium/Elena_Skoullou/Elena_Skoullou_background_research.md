  [Active Inference Symposium 2025](https://activeinference.org/symposium2025) (participant list)

- **Methodological Overlap:**  
  Her work on dynamic brain state transitions, network neuroscience, and computational modeling aligns with Active Inference’s focus on predictive coding, Bayesian inference, and brain network dynamics.  
  [SfN 2025 Abstract](https://www.sfn.org/meetings/sf-n-annual-meeting/abstracts)

### Adjacent Fields

- **Free Energy Principle:**  
  Her research on brain state transitions and network reconfiguration under emotional stimuli is conceptually related to the Free Energy Principle, which posits that the brain minimizes prediction error.  
  [SfN 2025 Abstract](https://www.sfn.org/meetings/sf-n-annual-meeting/abstracts)

- **Bayesian Inference:**  
  Her use of machine learning and network analysis in neuroimaging is compatible with Bayesian approaches to modeling brain function.

  [ISI Lab](http://www.isi.imi.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/member/?lang=en)

### Potential Applications to Active Inference

- Her expertise in dynamic functional connectivity and brain state transitions could be applied to modeling how the brain updates beliefs under uncertainty, a core tenet of Active Inference.  
- Her work on emotionally evocative stimuli could inform models of how affective states influence belief updating and action selection.  
  [SfN 2025 Abstract](https://www.sfn.org/meetings/sf-n-annual-meeting/abstracts)

### Research Gaps

- There is a need for more empirical validation of Active Inference models in human neuroimaging, particularly in dynamic, real-world contexts.  
- Her work on brain state transitions could help bridge the gap between theoretical models and empirical data.
