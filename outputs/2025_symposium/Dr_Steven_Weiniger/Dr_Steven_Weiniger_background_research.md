## Active Inference & Related Research

**Direct Connections to Active Inference**  
No publications, presentations, or projects explicitly linking Dr. Weiniger to **Active Inference**, **free energy principle**, **Bayesian inference**, or **computational neuroscience** were found in available sources. His recent work on **interoceptive posture awareness** has potential conceptual overlap with Active Inference—particularly in the domains of **embodied cognition** and **sensorimotor integration**—but no explicit methodological or theoretical engagement with Active Inference frameworks was identified.

**Methodological Overlap**  
His use of **photographic posture assessment** suggests an interest in **quantitative, reproducible measurement**, which could complement Active Inference research focused on **modeling bodily states and perception**. However, no evidence of mathematical modeling, simulation, or computational approaches was found.

**Potential Applications**  
Dr. Weiniger’s expertise in **posture biomechanics** and **interoceptive awareness** could inform Active Inference models of **embodied self-monitoring** and **adaptive behavior**. His clinical and public health focus offers a bridge to **applied, patient-centered outcomes**, a potential growth area for Active Inference in rehabilitation sciences.

**Research Gaps**  
The field lacks **empirical studies** linking posture awareness to computational models of inference and action. Dr. Weiniger is well-positioned to contribute **clinical datasets** and **applied protocols** that could test Active Inference hypotheses in real-world settings.

**Note on Limitations:**  
Despite exhaustive searches across academic databases, professional networks, and institutional pages, Dr. Weiniger’s peer-reviewed publication record is limited, and no direct engagement with Active Inference literature was found. His primary impact is in clinical education, public health, and applied posture science. Recent work suggests a nascent interest in the cognitive neuroscience of posture, which may align with future Active Inference research. All claims are based on verifiable, publicly available information as of November 2025. Where information is unavailable, this is explicitly noted.
