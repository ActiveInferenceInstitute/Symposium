Based on Dr. Weiniger's background in chiropractic medicine, focus on interoceptive awareness, and interest in behavioral change, I'll design a personalized Active Inference curriculum that bridges clinical practice with theoretical frameworks.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Strong foundation in clinical practice and somatic awareness
- Extensive experience in behavioral modification and patient education
- Limited exposure to formal Active Inference theory
- Learning style likely favors practical, clinical applications
- Strong teaching/communication background

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Month 1-2: Foundations
- Active Inference basics through clinical lens
- Mapping interoceptive awareness to predictive processing
- Behavioral change frameworks

Month 3-4: Clinical Applications
- Integration with existing practice
- Patient assessment tools
- Intervention design

Month 5-6: Advanced Implementation
- Research design
- Outcome measurements
- Protocol development

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
Module 1: Active Inference Fundamentals
- Free energy principle basics
- Predictive processing in body awareness
- Interoception and active inference

Module 2: Clinical Translation
- Mapping theory to practice
- Assessment frameworks
- Intervention design

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
- Case study development using existing patient data
- Protocol design workshops
- Assessment tool development
- Pilot program implementation

5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**
- Computational models of interoception
- Research design for clinical validation
- Integration with existing posture awareness methods
- Novel assessment strategies

6. **PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS**
Clinical Implementation:
- Patient assessment protocols
- Treatment planning frameworks
- Outcome measurement tools
- Integration with photographic strategy

7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**
- Introduction to key Active Inference researchers
- Collaboration opportunities with computational neuroscientists
- Clinical research network development
- Conference presentation opportunities

8. **ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION**
Milestones:
- Basic theory comprehension (Month 1)
- Protocol development (Month 3)
- Pilot program design (Month 5)
- Research protocol completion (Month 6)

9. **RESOURCES AND TOOLS**
Essential Readings:
- "Active Inference" by Thomas Parr et al.
- Key papers on interoception and active inference
- Clinical implementation studies
- Relevant software tools for assessment

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

Short-term (1-3 months):
- Master Active Inference fundamentals
- Develop initial assessment protocols
- Begin pilot program design

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Implement pilot program
- Collect preliminary data
- Develop research protocol

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Full program implementation
- Research study initiation
- Publication preparation

Success Metrics:
- Protocol development completion
- Pilot program implementation
- Patient outcome measures
- Research protocol approval

This curriculum emphasizes practical clinical application while building theoretical understanding. It leverages Dr. Weiniger's extensive clinical experience while introducing new frameworks for understanding and implementing behavioral change through Active Inference principles.
