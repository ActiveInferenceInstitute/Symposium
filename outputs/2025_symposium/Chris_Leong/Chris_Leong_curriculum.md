Based on Chris's background in risk management, governance, and compliance for responsible innovation, I'll design a personalized Active Inference curriculum that emphasizes practical applications in regulatory and risk contexts.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Starting from fundamentals given no prior Active Inference experience
- Strong analytical background in risk assessment can be leveraged
- Governance perspective suggests preference for structured, systematic learning
- Focus on practical applications and use cases aligns with stated needs

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Months 1-2: Foundations
- Basic principles of Active Inference through risk management lens
- Fundamental concepts: free energy, belief updating, policy selection
- Connection to existing risk frameworks

Months 3-4: Application Development
- Mapping Active Inference to compliance scenarios
- Risk-based decision-making models
- Governance implementation strategies

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
Module 1: Fundamentals
- Bayesian inference basics
- Free energy principle
- Markov Decision Processes

Module 2: Risk Integration
- Active Inference in uncertainty quantification
- Decision-making under incomplete information
- Compliance modeling frameworks

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
- Python tutorials using Active Inference frameworks
- Risk scenario modeling exercises
- Compliance case study implementations
- Simple simulations of governance systems

5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**
- Active Inference in regulatory systems
- Dynamic risk assessment models
- Predictive governance frameworks
- Emerging applications in responsible innovation

6. **PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS**
Risk Management Applications:
- Risk prediction and mitigation
- Compliance monitoring systems
- Governance framework optimization
- Decision support systems

7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**
- Join Active Inference Institute
- Participate in governance-focused working groups
- Connect with risk management practitioners
- Attend relevant workshops and conferences

8. **ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION**
Milestones:
- Basic model implementation
- Risk scenario analysis
- Compliance framework development
- Complete governance case study

9. **RESOURCES AND TOOLS**
Essential Reading:
- "Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior"
- Selected papers on regulatory applications
- Risk management case studies

Tools:
- PyAI (Python Active Inference library)
- Compliance modeling software
- Risk assessment frameworks

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

Short-term (1-3 months):
- Master fundamental concepts
- Complete basic tutorials
- Identify specific use cases

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Develop risk models
- Implement simple applications
- Create compliance frameworks

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Build comprehensive governance systems
- Contribute to practice development
- Integration with existing frameworks

Success Metrics:
- Implementation of working models
- Development of practical applications
- Integration with current role
- Contribution to field advancement

This curriculum emphasizes practical applications in risk management and governance while building a solid theoretical foundation. It's designed to help Chris understand both the theory and practical implementation of Active Inference in their professional context.
