I notice some key information about Ri Xu's background, current Active Inference application, and specific challenges is missing. To create a truly personalized curriculum, I'll need those details. However, I can design an adaptable curriculum framework focused on their stated interests in education, science communication, and AI-assisted reasoning.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Initial diagnostic assessment focusing on:
  * Basic probability theory and Bayesian inference
  * Information theory fundamentals
  * Current understanding of predictive processing
  * Experience with computational modeling
  * Familiarity with educational theory

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
- Foundation Phase (1-2 months):
  * Free Energy Principle basics
  * Markov Decision Processes
  * Belief updating and learning
  * Educational theory integration

- Application Phase (2-4 months):
  * Learning design through Active Inference lens
  * Communication model development
  * AI system interaction patterns
  * Practical implementations

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
Module 1: Active Inference Fundamentals
- Free Energy Principle
- Predictive processing
- Belief updating
- Action-perception cycles

Module 2: Educational Applications
- Learning as active inference
- Student modeling
- Adaptive curriculum design
- Assessment frameworks

Module 3: Communication Systems
- Information flow modeling
- Uncertainty management
- Message optimization
- Feedback loops

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
- Jupyter notebook tutorials using PyAI
- Educational scenario modeling
- Communication system prototyping
- Interactive case studies
- Weekly practical exercises

Would you like me to continue with the remaining sections? Also, could you provide more information about Ri's background and specific challenges to help me refine this framework further?
