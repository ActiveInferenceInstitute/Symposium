**Note:** Despite exhaustive search across academic databases and professional networks, **Ri Xu's public academic footprint is limited primarily to her role as a scientific communicator and medical writer at XURI Medical**, with no publicly indexed scholarly profiles or direct Active Inference research outputs found. This suggests her participation in the Active Inference Symposium may be in a scientific communication or interdisciplinary collaboration capacity rather than as a primary researcher.

If you require, I can continue monitoring or attempt contact for more detailed insights or unpublished work.
