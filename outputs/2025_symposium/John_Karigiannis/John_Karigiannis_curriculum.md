I notice that several key details about John Karigiannis's background, current applications, learning needs, challenges, and desired values are missing. To create a truly personalized curriculum, I'll need this information. However, I can help gather this information through a structured assessment approach.

Let's start with an initial assessment framework to gather the necessary information:

**Initial Assessment Questions for John:**

1. **Background Assessment:**
- What is your educational/professional background?
- What is your current level of mathematical proficiency?
- What is your experience with computational modeling?
- What is your familiarity with cognitive science and/or neuroscience?

2. **Current Active Inference Understanding:**
- How would you describe your current understanding of Active Inference?
- Have you worked with any Active Inference models or applications?
- What aspects of Active Inference interest you most?

3. **Learning Needs Assessment:**
- What specific skills do you want to develop?
- What are your immediate learning priorities?
- How do you prefer to learn (e.g., theoretical, practical, visual, hands-on)?

4. **Challenge Identification:**
- What obstacles have you encountered in learning Active Inference?
- What technical or conceptual aspects do you find most challenging?
- What time constraints or resource limitations do you face?

5. **Value Objectives:**

Once you provide these details, I can create a fully customized curriculum that:
