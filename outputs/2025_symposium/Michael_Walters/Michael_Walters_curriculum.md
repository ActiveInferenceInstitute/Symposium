Based on the provided arXiv paper link (a paper on open-source Active Inference for robotics), I'll design a curriculum focused on computational and robotic applications of Active Inference. I'll make some reasonable assumptions about Michael's background and needs.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Strong technical background in robotics/computer science (inferred from paper interest)
- Likely familiar with basic machine learning and control theory
- Gaps may exist in:
  * Variational inference fundamentals
  * Free energy principle theoretical foundations
  * Practical Active Inference implementation

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Months 1-2: Foundations
- Free Energy Principle basics
- Variational inference fundamentals
- Active Inference for control systems

Months 3-4: Implementation
- Computational frameworks
- Robotics applications
- Practical coding exercises

Months 5-6: Advanced Applications
- Custom implementation
- Research contributions
- System optimization

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
Module 1: Mathematical Foundations
- Variational Bayes
- Information geometry
- State-space models

Module 2: Active Inference Theory
- Free Energy Principle
- Markov Decision Processes
- Policy selection

Module 3: Robotics Integration
- Sensorimotor loops
- Policy implementation
- Environment modeling

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
- Python implementation using pymdp
- Active Inference for Robotics (AIR) framework
- Simple robotic control tasks
- Gradual complexity scaling

5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**
- Deep Active Inference
- Multi-agent systems
- Hierarchical models
- Real-time implementation
- Continuous state-spaces

6. **PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS**
- Robotic control implementation
- Sensor integration
- Performance optimization
- Debug and troubleshooting
- Benchmark comparisons

7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**
- Active Inference Institute
- GitHub repositories
- Academic conferences
- Online forums
- Research collaborations

8. **ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION**
Milestones:
1. Basic implementation working
2. Custom agent development
3. Complex task solving
4. Research contribution

9. **RESOURCES AND TOOLS**
Essential Reading:
- "Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior"
- Key papers by Karl Friston
- Technical documentation for AIR

Tools:
- Python
- PyMDP
- AIR framework
- Simulation environments

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

Short-term (1-3 months):
- Master theoretical foundations
- Complete basic implementations
- Join community forums

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Develop custom agents
- Contribute to open-source
- Start research projects

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Advanced implementations
- Research publications
- Community contributions

Success Metrics:
- Working implementations
- Research outputs
- Community engagement
- System performance benchmarks

This curriculum emphasizes:
1. Strong theoretical foundation
2. Practical implementation skills
3. Research contribution potential
4. Community engagement
5. Real-world application
