Based on the provided arXiv paper link (which appears to be your own work on Frugal Active Inference Agents), I'll design a personalized curriculum that builds on your existing research interests and mathematical background while focusing on experimental applications of Active Inference.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Strong mathematical/computational background evidenced by research work
- Advanced understanding of agent-based modeling and optimization
- Already working with Active Inference implementations
- Focus needed on experimental design and validation methods
- Gap identified in bridging theoretical models with empirical testing

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Month 1-2: Experimental Design Foundations
- Statistical validation methods for ActInf models
- Empirical testing frameworks
- Hypothesis formulation for ActInf experiments

Month 3-4: Implementation & Testing
- Benchmark development
- Comparative analysis methods
- Performance metrics design

Month 5-6: Advanced Applications
- Multi-agent experimental frameworks
- Scalability testing
- Real-world deployment strategies

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
- Advanced Free Energy Principle applications
- Experimental design for ActInf systems
- Validation methodologies
- Performance benchmarking
- Statistical analysis for ActInf experiments

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
- Design and implement experimental testbeds
- Create benchmark suites for frugal agents
- Develop validation frameworks
- Build automated testing pipelines
- Comparative analysis tools development

5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**
- Multi-agent experimental design
- Scalability analysis methods
- Novel metrics development
- Hybrid approaches combining ActInf with other frameworks
- Experimental validation of frugal approaches

6. **PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS**
- Empirical validation of frugal agents
- Performance comparison frameworks
- Real-world deployment testing
- Scalability assessment
- Resource utilization analysis

7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**
- Connect with experimental ActInf researchers
- Share benchmark tools and frameworks
- Contribute to open-source ActInf projects
- Present findings at workshops/conferences

8. **ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION**
Milestones:
- Experimental framework development
- Benchmark suite creation
- Validation methodology implementation
- Publication of experimental results
- Community tool contributions

9. **RESOURCES AND TOOLS**
- Statistical analysis packages
- Experimental design software
- Benchmark frameworks
- ActInf implementation libraries
- Data visualization tools

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**
Short-term (1-3 months):
- Develop experimental validation framework
- Create initial benchmark suite
- Implement statistical analysis pipeline

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Conduct comparative experiments
- Publish experimental results
- Release open-source tools

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Establish comprehensive validation framework
- Create standardized benchmark collection
- Build automated testing platform

This curriculum emphasizes experimental validation and practical implementation while building on your existing theoretical foundation. It focuses on developing robust testing frameworks and empirical validation methods for Active Inference agents, particularly in the context of frugal approaches.

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of this curriculum or adjust the focus areas based on additional specific needs?
