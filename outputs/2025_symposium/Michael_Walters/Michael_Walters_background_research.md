## 4. Active Inference & Related Research

- No direct evidence that any of the Michael Walters profiles found are engaged explicitly in **Active Inference** research as formalized in neuroscience or machine learning literature.

- However, the AI researcher Michael Walters involved in hybrid neural nets and deep learning [3], and the arXiv preprint linked by the user (dated 2025) may be related to AI agent systems, which could conceptually overlap with Active Inference frameworks.

- No publications or public projects explicitly mentioning **Active Inference**, Free Energy Principle, Bayesian inference, or computational neuroscience frameworks were uncovered for this Michael Walters.

- The arXiv preprint (https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04249) linked by the user was not fully accessible for author details but may be the best lead for Active Inference-related work.

## 7. Future Potential & Opportunities

- The linked arXiv preprint (2025) suggests ongoing work in AI agent systems potentially connected to Active Inference paradigms, indicating emerging research directions in AI safety and agent frameworks [5].

- AI Michael Walters’ Industry-PhD and collaborations with Framatome GmbH highlight potential applications of AI and safety in nuclear experimental contexts, possibly overlapping with Active Inference principles in adaptive systems.

- The lack of direct Active Inference publications suggests an opportunity for this researcher to bridge AI engineering with formal Active Inference computational neuroscience models.

- Strategic collaborations could include established Active Inference researchers (e.g., Karl Friston’s group) or AI safety researchers developing hybrid neural nets and agent systems.
