As of the current search, exact numbers are not provided here, but his profile is publicly accessible for up-to-date metrics.\n\n**Collaborative Networks**  \nA sample publication lists co-authors such as M. Kuipers, M. Richter, D. Scheepers, and E. Sjak-Shie, indicating interdisciplinary collaboration, particularly in psychophysiology and cognitive neuroscience[3]. Full co-author networks can be explored via his Google Scholar profile[3].\n\n**Recent Preprints and Working Papers**  \nNo preprints on arXiv, bioRxiv, or similar platforms were located in the current search results.\n\n---\n\n## Professional Experience\n\n**Complete Employment History**  \nDr. Immink is currently an **Associate Professor in Exercise and Sport Science** at Flinders University[1][2]. No information about previous employment, industry experience, consulting work, or professional affiliations beyond his current role is available in the current search results.\n\n**Professional Affiliations and Society Memberships**  \nNot specified in available sources.\n\n**Leadership Roles in Professional Organizations**  \nNot specified in available sources.\n\n**Patents, Technical Reports, or Applied Work**  \nNo patents, technical reports, or applied industry work are mentioned in the current search results.\n\n---\n\n## Active Inference & Related Research\n\n**Direct Connections to Active Inference**  \nNo explicit publications, presentations, or projects directly referencing “Active Inference,” “free energy principle,” or “Bayesian inference” in the context of Dr. Immink’s work were found in the current search results. His research, as described, focuses on **motor learning**, **cognitive control**, and **sport psychology** using behavioral and psychophysiological methods[1][3]. While his methodological approach is compatible with computational modeling and could theoretically intersect with Active Inference frameworks, there is no direct evidence of such integration in his published work to date.\n\n**Adjacent Fields**  \nDr. Immink’s expertise in **motor learning** and **cognitive control** is adjacent to fields like computational neuroscience and cognitive modeling, but no direct engagement with Bayesian inference or free energy principle frameworks is documented in the available sources.\n\n**Methodological Overlap**  \nHis research employs **serial reaction time tasks**, **sequence learning**, and **psychophysiological measures**, which could be formalized within computational or Bayesian models, but no such formalizations are evident in the current literature[1][3].\n\n**Potential Applications to Active Inference**  \nTheoretically, Dr. Immink’s focus on how the brain learns and refines skilled movements could benefit from Active Inference models, which formalize perception and action under uncertainty. However, no published work directly applies these frameworks to his research questions.\n\n**Research Gaps**  \nGiven his expertise in motor learning and cognitive control, Dr. Immink is well-positioned to address gaps in how Active Inference models can explain skill acquisition, error correction, and the role of anticipation in movement. However, no explicit work in this direction is documented in the current search results.\n\n---\n\n## Academic & Professional Network\n\n**Key Collaborators**  \nCo-authors on recent work include M. Kuipers, M. Richter, D. Scheepers, and E. Sjak-Shie, as seen in a publication indexed on Google Scholar[3].

This suggests ongoing interest in the interface between cognition and movement, a natural fit for Active Inference frameworks.\n\n**Opportunities for Growth in Active Inference**  \nDr. Immink’s expertise in motor control and learning positions him to contribute to Active Inference by applying these models to skill acquisition, error-based learning, and anticipatory processes in movement. However, there is no current evidence of such integration in his published work.\n\n**Potential Impact on the Field**  \nShould Dr. Immink engage with Active Inference, his empirical and methodological rigor could help validate and refine computational models of motor learning, bridging gaps between theory and experimental data.\n\n**Strategic Collaboration Opportunities**  \nCollaboration with computational neuroscientists, Bayesian modelers, and researchers in the Active Inference community could catalyze new directions in understanding the neural and cognitive basis of skilled movement.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table: Key Findings\n\n| Aspect                  | Status/Findings                                                                 | Source Links                                                                 |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Academic Position       | Associate Professor, Exercise & Sport Science, Flinders University              | [1], [2]                                                                     |\n| Research Focus          | Motor learning, control, sport psychology, cognitive neuroscience               | [1]                                                                          |\n| Recent Publication      | “The role of action effects in motor sequence learning…” (Psych Research, 2023) | DOI: [10.1007/s00426-023-01900-1](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00426-023-01900-1)|\n| Google Scholar Profile  | Available                                                                       | [3]                                                                          |\n| ORCID                   | 0000-0002-4652-0090                                                             | [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4652-0090)                              |\n| Institutional Profile   | Available                                                                       | [2]                                                                          |\n| Direct Active Inference | No evidence in current publications                                             | —                                                                            |\n| Social Media/Code       | Not found                                                                       | —                                                                            |\n| Collaborators           | M.
