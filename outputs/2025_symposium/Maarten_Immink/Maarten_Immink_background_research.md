## Active Inference & Related Research

**Direct Connections to Active Inference**  
No explicit publications, presentations, or projects directly referencing “Active Inference,” “free energy principle,” or “Bayesian inference” in the context of Dr. Immink’s work were found in the current search results. His research, as described, focuses on **motor learning**, **cognitive control**, and **sport psychology** using behavioral and psychophysiological methods[1][3]. While his methodological approach is compatible with computational modeling and could theoretically intersect with Active Inference frameworks, there is no direct evidence of such integration in his published work to date.

**Adjacent Fields**  
Dr. Immink’s expertise in **motor learning** and **cognitive control** is adjacent to fields like computational neuroscience and cognitive modeling, but no direct engagement with Bayesian inference or free energy principle frameworks is documented in the available sources.

**Methodological Overlap**  
His research employs **serial reaction time tasks**, **sequence learning**, and **psychophysiological measures**, which could be formalized within computational or Bayesian models, but no such formalizations are evident in the current literature[1][3].

**Potential Applications to Active Inference**  
Theoretically, Dr. Immink’s focus on how the brain learns and refines skilled movements could benefit from Active Inference models, which formalize perception and action under uncertainty. However, no published work directly applies these frameworks to his research questions.

**Research Gaps**  
Given his expertise in motor learning and cognitive control, Dr. Immink is well-positioned to address gaps in how Active Inference models can explain skill acquisition, error correction, and the role of anticipation in movement. However, no explicit work in this direction is documented in the current search results.

## Future Potential & Opportunities

**Emerging Research Directions**  
Based on his recent publication in *Psychological Research*, Dr. Immink continues to investigate the cognitive and neural mechanisms of motor learning, with a focus on action effects and sequence learning[DOI: 10.1007/s00426-023-01900-1]. This suggests ongoing interest in the interface between cognition and movement, a natural fit for Active Inference frameworks.

**Opportunities for Growth in Active Inference**  
Dr. Immink’s expertise in motor control and learning positions him to contribute to Active Inference by applying these models to skill acquisition, error-based learning, and anticipatory processes in movement. However, there is no current evidence of such integration in his published work.

**Potential Impact on the Field**  
Should Dr. Immink engage with Active Inference, his empirical and methodological rigor could help validate and refine computational models of motor learning, bridging gaps between theory and experimental data.

**Strategic Collaboration Opportunities**  
Collaboration with computational neuroscientists, Bayesian modelers, and researchers in the Active Inference community could catalyze new directions in understanding the neural and cognitive basis of skilled movement.
