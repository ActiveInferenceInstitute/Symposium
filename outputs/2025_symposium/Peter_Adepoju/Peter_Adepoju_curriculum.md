I notice that several key pieces of information are missing from Peter's profile (background, current Active Inference application, pragmatic value sought, and epistemic value sought). I'll design a flexible curriculum that can be refined once these details are provided, focusing on the known challenge of scaling, standardization, and empirical grounding.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Initial assessment questionnaire focusing on:
  * Mathematical background (statistics, calculus, linear algebra)
  * Programming experience
  * Prior exposure to Bayesian inference and machine learning
  * Domain expertise
- Skills inventory mapping
- Learning style assessment through practical exercises

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Foundational Track (adjustable based on assessment):
- Month 1: Fundamentals of Active Inference
- Month 2-3: Computational Implementation
- Month 4-6: Scaling and Standardization Focus

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
- Free Energy Principle foundations
- Markov Decision Processes
- Variational inference basics
- Hierarchical generative models
- Special focus on scalability challenges:
  * Computational efficiency
  * Model standardization
  * Empirical validation methods

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
- Python implementation using PyAI framework
- Practical exercises with increasing complexity:
  * Simple decision-making models
  * Multi-agent systems
  * Large-scale applications
- Weekly coding challenges
- Benchmark testing implementations

5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**
- Scaling strategies for Active Inference
- Distributed computing approaches
- Standardization methodologies
- Empirical validation techniques
- Integration with existing ML frameworks

6. **PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS**
Focus on scaling challenges:
- Case studies of successful large-scale implementations
- Standardization protocols
- Empirical validation frameworks
- Performance optimization techniques
- Benchmarking methodologies

7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**
- Active participation in the Active Inference Institute
- GitHub project contributions
- Conference participation planning
- Collaboration opportunities on scaling challenges
- Regular community calls

8. **ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION**
Milestone projects:
- Building a scalable Active Inference model
- Implementing standardization protocols
- Conducting empirical validation
- Documentation of results
- Peer review process

9. **RESOURCES AND TOOLS**
Essential resources:
- Active Inference Papers Database
- PyAI documentation
- Scaling tutorials and guides
- Standardization frameworks
- Community forums and discussion boards
- Code repositories
- Benchmark datasets

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

Short-term (1-3 months):
- Master fundamental concepts
- Complete basic implementations
- Join community platforms

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Develop scalable solutions
- Implement standardization protocols
- Contribute to community projects

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Lead scaling initiatives
- Publish findings
- Mentor others

This curriculum can be further customized once we have more information about Peter's:
- Technical background
- Current application domain
- Specific learning objectives
- Professional goals

The focus on scaling, standardization, and empirical grounding will remain central, but the depth and approach to these challenges can be adjusted based on Peter's specific context and needs.
