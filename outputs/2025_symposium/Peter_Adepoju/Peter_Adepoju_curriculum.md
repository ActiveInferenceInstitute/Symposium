Based on the limited information provided, I'll create a curriculum framework that focuses on resources, tools, and addressing scaling/standardization challenges in Active Inference. This can be refined once more details about Peter's specific background and goals are available.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Initial focus on technical competency in probabilistic modeling
- Evaluate familiarity with Bayesian inference and variational methods
- Assess programming skills (Python/MATLAB experience)
- Review understanding of free energy principle fundamentals

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
- Start with foundational mathematical concepts
- Progress to computational implementations
- Focus on scalable architectures and standardization
- Timeline: 6-month intensive program with quarterly milestones

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
Module 1: Mathematical Foundations
- Variational Bayes
- Information geometry
- Markov Decision Processes

Module 2: Active Inference Fundamentals
- Free Energy Principle
- Generative models
- Belief updating

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
- Implementation using PyAI and SPM
- Small-scale simulation projects
- Gradient scaling exercises
- Model optimization techniques

5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**
- Distributed Active Inference
- Multi-agent systems
- Hierarchical models
- Performance optimization

6. **PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS**
- Scalable architecture design
- Standardization protocols
- Empirical validation methods
- Benchmarking frameworks

7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**
- Join Active Inference Institute
- Participate in PyAI development
- Attend IWAI conferences
- Connect with scaling working groups

8. **ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION**
Milestone 1: Basic Implementation
- Complete tutorial implementations
- Understand scaling limitations

Milestone 2: Advanced Applications
- Design scalable architecture
- Implement standardization protocols

9. **RESOURCES AND TOOLS**
Software:
- PyAI
- SPM12
- Julia-based frameworks

Literature:
- "Active Inference" (Da Costa et al.)
- "Free Energy, Value, and Attractors" (Friston et al.)
- Scaling papers from recent conferences

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

Short-term (1-3 months):
- Master fundamental mathematics
- Complete basic implementations
- Identify scaling bottlenecks

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Develop scalable solutions
- Implement standardization protocols
- Contribute to open-source tools

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Lead scaling initiatives
- Publish implementation guidelines
- Contribute to standardization efforts

This curriculum framework emphasizes practical implementation and scaling challenges. It can be further customized once more information about Peter's specific background and goals is provided.

Key success metrics:
- Implementation of scalable Active Inference models
- Contribution to standardization efforts
- Development of empirical validation methods
- Creation of reusable, efficient code bases
