### Notes on Research Limitations

- The search yielded **very limited direct information** on Peter Adepoju’s academic background, publications, and professional activities beyond his ORCID record and affiliation with AIMS.
- This could be due to early career stage, limited online footprint, or non-publication of work under that exact name.
- No direct evidence links him to Active Inference beyond the symposium participation, suggesting future research or emerging involvement.
