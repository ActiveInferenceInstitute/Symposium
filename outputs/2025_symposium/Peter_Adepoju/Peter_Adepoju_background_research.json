Active Inference & Related Research\n\n- **Direct Connections to Active Inference:**\n  - No publications, presentations, or projects explicitly mentioning Active Inference by Peter Adepoju.\n  - Limited publicly available research linking his work to the Free Energy Principle or Bayesian inference frameworks.\n\n- **Adjacent Fields:**\n  - His affiliation with AIMS and computational modeling suggests potential overlap with Bayesian modeling and mathematical frameworks relevant to Active Inference, but no direct evidence.\n\n- **Methodological Overlap:**\n  - Possible application of mathematical simulation and modeling techniques relevant to Active Inference, but no specific documented projects.\n\n- **Potential Applications:**\n  - Given expertise in computational mathematics, possible contributions to Active Inference modeling frameworks or simulations in biological systems.\n\n- **Research Gaps:**\n  - Insufficient data to determine specific gaps he is addressing in Active Inference.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Academic & Professional Network\n\n- **Key Collaborators:**\n  - No documented co-authors or collaborators found online.\n  - AIMS researchers typically collaborate pan-Africanly, but no explicit network was identified.\n\n- **Conference Presentations:**\n  - No records of conference talks or symposium presentations found.\n\n- **Workshop Participation:**\n  - No online records of workshop organization or participation.\n\n- **Community Engagement:**\n  - No blogs, tutorials, or code repositories publicly linked.\n\n- **Social Media Presence:**\n  - No active research-related social media profiles identified.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Online Presence & Resources\n\n| Resource Type        | Link / Status                                |\n|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Personal Website     | None found                                  |\n| Google Scholar      | None found                                  |\n| ResearchGate        | None found                                  |\n| LinkedIn            | No confirmed profile matching               |\n| GitHub              | None found                                  |\n| Twitter/X           | None associated                             |\n| ORCID               | [0000-0002-6406-0366](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6406-0366) |\n| Institutional Page  | Not available on AIMS public site           |\n| Videos/Podcasts     | None found                                  |\n\n---\n\n### 7. Future Potential & Opportunities\n\n- **Emerging Research Directions:**\n  - Potential growth in computational modeling and machine learning applied to biological systems and African bioinformatics.\n  - Opportunities for engaging more explicitly with Active Inference frameworks through AIMS’s network and interdisciplinary projects.\n\n- **Opportunities for Active Inference Community:**\n  - Collaboration with African and global researchers focusing on mathematical frameworks could enhance regional perspectives in Active Inference modeling.\n\n- **Potential Impact:**\n  - With further development and visibility, could contribute to bridging mathematical modeling with Active Inference in African scientific contexts.\n\n- **Strategic Collaborations:**\n  - Possible partnerships with African BioGenome Project researchers and computational neuroscientists working on Free Energy Principle in Africa and globally.\n\n---\n\n### Notes on Research Limitations\n\n- The search yielded **very limited direct information** on Peter Adepoju’s academic background, publications, and professional activities beyond his ORCID record and affiliation with AIMS.\n- This could be due to early career stage, limited online footprint, or non-publication of work under that exact name.\n- No direct evidence links him to Active Inference beyond the symposium participation, suggesting future research or emerging involvement.\n\n---\n\n# References\n\n1.
