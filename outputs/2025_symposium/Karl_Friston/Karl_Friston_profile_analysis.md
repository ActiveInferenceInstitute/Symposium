I'll provide a comprehensive profile analysis for Karl Friston, who is actually one of the primary architects of Active Inference theory:

**EXPERTISE ASSESSMENT**
- World-leading expert in theoretical neuroscience and the originator of Active Inference theory
- Pioneer of Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) and the Free Energy Principle
- Extensive background in psychiatry, neuroscience, and mathematical modeling
- Currently Scientific Director at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging
- Over 1000 peer-reviewed publications with revolutionary contributions to neuroscience

**LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES**
- While Friston is a leading expert, potential areas for development include:
  - Emerging applications of Active Inference in artificial intelligence
  - Novel computational implementations 
  - Integration with other theoretical frameworks
  - Practical applications in robotics and real-world systems

**RESEARCH INTERESTS ALIGNMENT**
- Core developer of Active Inference theory and its mathematical foundations
- Primary interests include:
  - Theoretical neuroscience
  - Bayesian modeling
  - Free Energy Principle
  - Applications to psychiatry and consciousness
- Continues to expand the theoretical framework and its applications

**COLLABORATION POTENTIAL**
- Key position to guide collaborative research initiatives
- Can provide theoretical oversight and validation
- Valuable mentor for emerging researchers
- Bridge builder between different disciplines applying Active Inference

**SYMPOSIUM PARTICIPATION STRATEGY**
- Likely role as keynote speaker and thought leader
- Focus on:
  - Sharing latest theoretical developments
  - Guiding discussions on future directions
  - Mentoring emerging researchers
  - Building consensus on key challenges

**DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP**
Short-term:
- Share latest theoretical advances
- Guide community development

Medium-term:
- Expand Active Inference applications
- Foster interdisciplinary collaboration

Long-term:
- Establish Active Inference as a unified theory of brain function
- Develop practical applications across fields

**ACTIVE INFERENCE INTEGRATION**
- Central role in developing and advancing the theory
- Continues to:
  - Refine mathematical foundations
  - Expand theoretical applications
  - Guide practical implementations
  - Bridge theory and application

Additional Observations:
1. Karl Friston's presence adds significant credibility and depth to any Active Inference symposium
2. His expertise spans multiple disciplines, making him ideal for fostering interdisciplinary applications
3. His involvement can help validate new approaches and applications
4. His perspective on theoretical foundations is invaluable for ensuring coherent development of the field

Recommendations:
1. Leverage his expertise for theoretical validation of new applications
2. Create opportunities for direct interaction with emerging researchers
3. Focus on expanding practical applications while maintaining theoretical rigor
4. Document and disseminate his insights for broader community benefit

Given his foundational role in the field, Friston's participation would likely focus more on guiding and validating others' work rather than personal learning objectives. His presence adds immense value through his ability to connect theoretical foundations with practical applications across disciplines.
