I apologize, but I don't see any provided information about Petter Hörling in the query to conduct a comprehensive analysis. Without specific details about their background, current work, research interests, and goals, I cannot make accurate assessments or recommendations.

To provide a meaningful analysis across the requested dimensions (Expertise Assessment, Learning Opportunities, Research Interests Alignment, etc.), I would need information about:

1. Their academic/professional background
2. Current role and research interests
3. Experience with Active Inference
4. Specific goals for participating in the symposium
5. Current projects or applications they're working on
6. Technical skills and domain expertise
7. Learning objectives and challenges they face

If you could provide these details about Petter Hörling, I would be happy to conduct a thorough analysis following the structure you've outlined, including expertise assessment, learning opportunities, research alignment, collaboration potential, symposium strategy, development roadmap, and Active Inference integration.
