I notice that key information about Petter Hörling's background, current Active Inference application, learning needs, challenges, and desired pragmatic/epistemic values are missing. To create a truly personalized and effective curriculum, I'll need these details.

Could you please provide:

1. **Background**: 
- Academic/professional background
- Current field of work/research
- Prior experience with related concepts (e.g., Bayesian inference, machine learning)

2. **Current Active Inference Application**:
- How they currently use or plan to use Active Inference
- Specific domain or problem space

3. **Learning Needs**:
- Specific skills they want to develop
- Areas of Active Inference they want to master

4. **Challenges**:
- Current obstacles in understanding or applying Active Inference
- Time constraints or resource limitations

5. **Value Sought**:
- Pragmatic: Practical outcomes they hope to achieve
- Epistemic: Theoretical understanding they wish to develop

Once you provide these details, I can create a highly tailored curriculum that:
- Matches their current knowledge level
- Addresses specific gaps and challenges
- Focuses on relevant applications
- Provides appropriate resources and tools
- Sets realistic timelines and milestones

Would you please share these details so I can design a more targeted and effective learning path?
