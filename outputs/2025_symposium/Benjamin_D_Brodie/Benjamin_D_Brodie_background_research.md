After exhaustive and comprehensive web research, **there is no publicly available information linking an individual named “Benjamin D. Brodie” affiliated with itonomi to academic, professional, or research profiles, including ORCID, Google Scholar, LinkedIn, ResearchGate, or other scholarly databases.** The search also found no publications, conference presentations, or professional profiles matching this exact name and affiliation in the context of Active Inference or related fields.

### Key findings and clarifications:

1. **No academic or research profiles found for Benjamin D. Brodie (itonomi)**  
   - Searches in Google Scholar, ORCID, ResearchGate, LinkedIn, and institutional pages yielded no results for an individual named Benjamin D. Brodie connected to itonomi or Active Inference.  
   - No doctoral or graduate academic background, publications, or citations matching this name were located.  
   - No academic or professional webpages, CVs, or biographies are publicly accessible.

2. **Unrelated search results for similar names**  
   - Historical figures named Benjamin Brodie exist (e.g., Sir Benjamin Brodie, the 19th-century surgeon)[1][2], but these are completely unrelated to the modern research context or itonomi affiliation.  
   - A “Benjamin Brodie” listed as a teaching assistant in mathematics at University of Kentucky was found, but this person appears to be a different individual with no evident connection to Active Inference or itonomi[5].  
   - No social media activity or professional presence matching the query was identified.

3. **itonomi affiliation context**  
   - itonomi is a company focused on IoT (Internet of Things) data marketplaces and distributed computing. Public information about their team members or researchers does not list Benjamin D. Brodie or any Active Inference researchers.  
   - No public research or technical reports from itonomi connected to Active Inference or Bayesian modeling mention this person.

4. **Active Inference Symposium participant status**  
   - If Benjamin D. Brodie participated in an Active Inference Symposium, no public participant list or presentation materials are available online to confirm his involvement, background, or contributions.  
   - No talks, posters, or workshop materials linked to him in the Active Inference community repositories or conference websites.

### Summary:  
**There is a lack of verifiable public information about Benjamin D. Brodie affiliated with itonomi in academic, research, or professional domains relevant to Active Inference.** This profile appears to be either a private individual without public scholarly footprint or a participant whose online presence and publication record are not publicly indexed or accessible.

### Recommendations for further action:  
- Contact the Active Inference Symposium organizers or itonomi directly for participant or speaker details.  
- Request CVs or bios from the individual or affiliated institution for internal records.  
- Monitor future publications or conference proceedings for emerging information.
