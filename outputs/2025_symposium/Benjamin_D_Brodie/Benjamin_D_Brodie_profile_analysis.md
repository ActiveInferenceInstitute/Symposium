Based on the limited information provided, I'll analyze Benjamin D. Brodie's profile and make informed assumptions where data is missing. Here's my analysis:

1. **EXPERTISE ASSESSMENT**
- Currently appears to be in an evaluation/learning phase with Active Inference
- Technical background implied by interest in factor graph examples
- Likely has public sector experience given interest in case management
- Knowledge level appears to be beginner/intermediate in Active Inference

2. **LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES**
- Focus on practical implementations using open-source tools
- Need for hands-on factor graph examples and tutorials
- Recommended learning path:
  * Start with basic Active Inference principles
  * Progress to practical implementation examples
  * Focus on case management applications
- Should explore existing open-source Active Inference frameworks

3. **RESEARCH INTERESTS ALIGNMENT**
- Strong alignment with practical applications
- Potential focus areas:
  * Public sector applications
  * Case management systems
  * Decision support systems
- Could contribute to real-world implementation examples

4. **COLLABORATION POTENTIAL**
- Could partner with:
  * Technical implementers for factor graph development
  * Public sector practitioners
  * Case management experts
- Opportunity to bridge theory-practice gap
- Can contribute practical use cases

5. **SYMPOSIUM PARTICIPATION STRATEGY**
Priority focus areas:
- Practical implementation sessions
- Factor graph tutorials
- Case studies of real-world applications
- Networking with technical practitioners

6. **DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP**
Short-term:
- Master factor graph implementation
- Identify specific use cases

Medium-term:
- Develop proof-of-concept for case management
- Build practical implementation expertise

Long-term:
- Deploy Active Inference solutions in public sector
- Contribute to practical application knowledge base

7. **ACTIVE INFERENCE INTEGRATION**
- Strong potential for public sector applications
- Focus areas:
  * Case management optimization
  * Decision support systems
  * Resource allocation
- Integration strategy:
  * Start with small-scale pilots
  * Build evidence base
  * Scale successful implementations

Given the limited information, this analysis makes assumptions that should be validated. Key recommendations:

1. Focus on practical implementations and examples
2. Connect with technical practitioners
3. Build expertise in factor graphs
4. Identify specific public sector use cases
5. Develop implementation skills progressively

Additional information about background, current role, and specific challenges would allow for more detailed recommendations.
