Based on Benjamin's specific interest in open source factor graph examples and practical applications, I'll design a focused curriculum that emphasizes hands-on implementation while building necessary theoretical foundations.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Initial Focus: Factor graph implementation expertise
- Knowledge Gap: Bridging theoretical Active Inference with practical implementation
- Learning Style: Hands-on, example-based learning preferred

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Module 1: Factor Graph Fundamentals (2 weeks)
- Basic graph theory and probabilistic modeling
- Factor graph notation and structure
- Common factor graph patterns in Active Inference

Module 2: Implementation Tools (2 weeks)
- Julia-based frameworks (Gen.jl)
- Python implementations (PyMC3, Factor Graphs)
- Open source Active Inference libraries

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
- Factor Graph Representations of Free Energy
- Message Passing Algorithms
- Variational Message Passing in Active Inference
- Implementation Patterns and Best Practices

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
Practical Exercises:
- Simple factor graph implementation in Julia
- Building Active Inference models using existing libraries
- Converting theoretical models to factor graph representations
- Debugging and optimization techniques

5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**
- Hierarchical Factor Graphs
- Dynamic Factor Graphs for Time Series
- Optimization Methods for Large-Scale Graphs
- Custom Factor Implementation

6. **PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS**
Projects:
1. Basic Perception Model
2. Simple Action Selection
3. Hierarchical Active Inference Model
4. Real-world Application Integration

7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**
- Join Active Inference Institute
- Participate in Julia Computing community
- Contribute to open source Active Inference projects
- Share implementations on GitHub

8. **ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION**
Milestones:
- Complete basic factor graph implementation
- Build working Active Inference model
- Contribute to open source project
- Document and share implementations

9. **RESOURCES AND TOOLS**
Software:
- Julia Programming Environment
- Gen.jl
- ForneyLab.jl
- Python Active Inference libraries

Documentation:
- Factor Graph tutorials
- Active Inference examples repository
- Implementation guides
- Community documentation

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

Short-term (1-3 months):
- Master basic factor graph implementation
- Complete first Active Inference model
- Join relevant communities

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Contribute to open source projects
- Develop custom implementations
- Share working examples

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Create comprehensive example library
- Contribute to core libraries
- Mentor others in implementation

Success Metrics:
- Working implementations
- GitHub contributions
- Community engagement
- Documentation quality

This curriculum emphasizes practical implementation while ensuring theoretical understanding. Regular review and adjustment based on progress and feedback is recommended.
