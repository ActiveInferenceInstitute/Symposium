  "content": "After an exhaustive and deep web search across multiple academic and professional sources, including scholarly databases, professional social networks, institutional pages, research repositories, and conference records, **there is no verifiable information available on an individual named \"Benjamin D. Brodie\" affiliated with \"itonomi\" or connected to the Active Inference Symposium as of October 2025**.\n\n### Key Findings and Search Summary\n\n1. **No Academic Profiles or Publications Found for Benjamin D. Brodie (itonomi)**\n   - Searches on Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID, LinkedIn, and institutional databases yielded no academic or professional profiles matching the name Benjamin D. Brodie associated with itonomi or any active research in Active Inference or related fields.\n   - No publications, preprints, or conference presentations authored or co-authored by this name were found in relevant scientific fields such as neuroscience, computational modeling, machine learning, or cognitive science.\n   \n2. **No Professional Profiles or Employment Records**\n   - LinkedIn and professional networking sites do not list a Benjamin D. Brodie connected to itonomi or research in computational neuroscience, Active Inference, or AI.\n   - No public biographies, patents, technical reports, or consulting work linked to the name and affiliation were found.\n\n3. **No Active Inference or Related Research Contributions**\n   - No direct or indirect evidence of involvement in Active Inference, the free energy principle, Bayesian inference, or computational neuroscience was discovered.\n   - No conference proceedings, workshop participations, or symposium talks linked to this individual were identified.\n\n4. **Historical Namesakes Found but Not Relevant**\n   - The name Benjamin Brodie is historically prominent in medicine (Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie, 1783–1862), but this figure is unrelated to active inference or contemporary research. [1][2]\n   - No connection between this historical figure and the modern research domain or the specified affiliation.\n\n5. **Itonomi Company and Research**\n   - Itonomi appears to be a technology company focusing on IoT or related fields but does not publicly associate with Active Inference research or list Benjamin D. Brodie among its researchers or leadership in online materials.\n\n6. **Possible Reasons for Information Gap**\n   - The participant may be a private individual, early-career researcher without public profiles.\n   - The name may be a pseudonym or misspelling.\n   - The affiliation \"itonomi\" may be a corporate entity with non-public research activities.\n   - The participant's work might be unpublished or internal.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations for Further Verification\n\n- Check the official **Active Inference Symposium participant list or website** for direct contact or bio information.\n- Contact **itonomi** directly for information about Benjamin D. Brodie.\n- Review symposium recordings, proceedings, or abstracts for any mention.\n- Monitor future publications or social media announcements for emerging profiles.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table of Search Outcome\n\n| Research Aspect           | Findings                                  | Notes                          |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Academic Background      | No data found                             | No degrees, institutions, or profiles located |\n| Research Contributions   | None located                             | No papers, preprints, or citations |\n| Professional Experience  | No records found                         | No employment or consulting info |\n| Active Inference Research| No evidence                             | No publications or presentations |\n| Academic Network         | No collaborators or affiliations found  | No joint work or conference roles |\n| Online Presence          | None identified                         | No GitHub, LinkedIn, or social media |\n| Future Potential         | Cannot assess due to lack of data       | |\n\n---\n\nIf you have additional information such as an email, conference abstract, or alternate name spelling, please provide it to enable a more targeted search.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n1.
