No publications, conference presentations, professional profiles, or online resources substantiate academic or research activity. The individual’s self-reported lack of a professional academic background aligns with the absence of evidence in academic databases and professional networks. No connections to Active Inference, computational neuroscience, or related fields were found. All major academic and professional platforms were searched, and no substantive information was located beyond the existence of a largely empty ORCID profile.\n\n## References\n\n1. **ORCID – Daniel Englebretson**: [https://orcid.org/0009-0007-9396-8019](https://orcid.org/0009-0007-9396-8019)  \n   *(This is the sole verifiable online presence, containing no substantive information.)*\n\nNo other references were found after a comprehensive search of academic databases, professional networks, and institutional repositories.
