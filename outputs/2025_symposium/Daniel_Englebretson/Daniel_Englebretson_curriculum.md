Based on Daniel's unique background and goals, I'll design a personalized Active Inference curriculum that bridges his practical experience with theoretical foundations.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Strong practical implementation experience
- Self-taught systems approach to problem-solving
- Gaps in formal theoretical foundations
- Learning style appears to favor practical application with theoretical backing
- Natural aptitude for systems thinking and cross-domain integration

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Months 1-2: Theoretical Foundations
- Free Energy Principle fundamentals
- Bayesian inference basics
- Information theory essentials
- Focus on connecting existing practical knowledge with formal theory

Months 3-4: Mathematical Framework
- Variational inference
- Markov Decision Processes
- Emphasis on intuitive understanding before mathematical depth

Months 5-6: Advanced Integration
- Cross-domain applications
- System optimization
- Research contribution methods

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
Module 1: Foundations
- Free Energy Principle
- Predictive processing
- Belief updating
- Action-perception cycles

Module 2: Mathematical Framework
- Variational methods
- Probability theory
- Information geometry
- Optimization principles

Module 3: Implementation
- Policy selection
- Resource allocation

Tools:
- PyAI (Python Active Inference)
- Documentation frameworks
- Modeling tools

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

Short-term (1-3 months):
- Build theoretical foundation
- Document current system
- Identify integration points

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Implement formal Active Inference principles
- Develop validation methods
- Begin community engagement

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Prepare research contributions

- Community engagement level
- Research contribution potential

This curriculum emphasizes:
1. Bridging practical experience with formal theory
2. Maintaining focus on existing system improvement
3. Building towards meaningful research contributions
4. Balancing immediate practical value with theoretical depth
5. Creating opportunities for field contribution
