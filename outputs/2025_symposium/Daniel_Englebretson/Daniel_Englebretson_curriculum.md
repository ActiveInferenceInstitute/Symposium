Based on Daniel's unique background and objectives, I'll design a personalized Active Inference curriculum that bridges theoretical foundations with practical applications, particularly focusing on computational systems and universal problem-solving.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Strong practical implementation skills evidenced by working system
- Intuitive grasp of core concepts through application
- Knowledge gaps primarily in formal theoretical frameworks
- Self-directed learner with preference for practical application
- Need to formalize existing knowledge within academic framework

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Phase 1 (1-2 months): Theoretical Foundations
- Free Energy Principle fundamentals
- Bayesian inference basics
- Information theory essentials

Phase 2 (2-3 months): Bridging Theory and Practice
- Mapping existing system to Active Inference frameworks
- Formalizing intuitive understanding
- Connecting practical implementations to theoretical models

Phase 3 (3-6 months): Advanced Implementation
- Optimization of existing system
- Integration of formal Active Inference principles
- Development of novel applications

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
Module 1: Mathematical Foundations
- Variational Bayes
- Markov Decision Processes
- Information geometry

Module 2: Theoretical Frameworks

9. **RESOURCES AND TOOLS**
Key Readings:
- "Active Inference" by Thomas Parr et al.
- "The Free Energy Principle" by Karl Friston
- Relevant papers on computational implementations

Tools:
- SPM software
- PyAI
- Custom implementation tools
- Documentation platforms

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**
Short-term (1-3 months):
- Formalize existing system documentation
- Map to theoretical frameworks
- Identify novel contributions

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Optimize system based on formal principles
- Develop publication materials
- Engage with research community

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Contribute to field advancement
