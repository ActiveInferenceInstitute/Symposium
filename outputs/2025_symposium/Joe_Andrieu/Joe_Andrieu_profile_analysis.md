Based on the limited information provided, I can offer a preliminary analysis while noting significant information gaps that would need to be filled for a more complete assessment.

1. **EXPERTISE ASSESSMENT**
- Currently at beginning stages with Active Inference ("Just getting started")
- Unable to assess specific technical skills and research background without more information
- Would need more details about their professional background for comprehensive assessment

2. **LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES**
- As a beginner, would benefit from:
  * Foundational Active Inference concepts and mathematics
  * Introduction to key theoretical frameworks
  * Basic implementation tutorials
  * Understanding of practical applications
- Specific recommendations would depend on their background and goals

3. **RESEARCH INTERESTS ALIGNMENT**
- Insufficient information to determine specific research interests
- Could explore various entry points to Active Inference based on their background
- Would need to understand their domain expertise to suggest alignment opportunities

4. **COLLABORATION POTENTIAL**
- As a new entrant to the field, could:
  * Connect with other beginners for peer learning
  * Seek mentorship from experienced practitioners
  * Participate in introductory working groups
  * Share perspectives from their domain expertise

5. **SYMPOSIUM PARTICIPATION STRATEGY**
Priority focus should be on:
- Attending introductory sessions
- Participating in basic tutorials
- Networking with other participants
- Identifying potential mentors or collaborators

6. **DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP**
Short-term:
- Build foundational understanding
- Identify specific areas of interest
- Connect with community members

Medium/Long-term would depend on:
- Professional goals
- Domain expertise
- Intended applications

7. **ACTIVE INFERENCE INTEGRATION**
- Need more information about their background to suggest specific integration paths
- Could explore general applications while building knowledge base
- Should focus on understanding fundamental principles before specialized applications

**Recommendations:**
1. Provide more background information for better targeted guidance
2. Focus on foundational learning resources
3. Connect with other symposium participants at similar experience levels
4. Identify specific areas of interest within Active Inference
5. Develop clear learning objectives for the symposium

**Note:** This analysis is limited by the minimal information provided. A more detailed profile would allow for more specific and actionable recommendations.
