I notice that several key pieces of information about Joe Andrieu's background, learning needs, challenges, and desired outcomes are missing. To create a truly personalized curriculum, I would need to know more about:

1. His academic/professional background
2. Specific learning needs and goals
3. Current challenges he's facing
4. What practical outcomes he's seeking
5. His preferred learning style
6. Time availability and commitment level

However, I can provide an initial framework that can be refined once more information is available:

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Starting point: New to Active Inference
- Recommend initial self-assessment questionnaire to determine:
  * Mathematical background
  * Programming experience
  * Domain expertise
  * Learning preferences

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
- Begin with conceptual foundations:
  * Free Energy Principle basics
  * Markov Decision Processes
  * Bayesian inference fundamentals
- Progress to practical applications
- Start with high-level concepts before mathematical depth

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
- Module 1: Introduction to Active Inference
- Module 2: Bayesian Foundations
- Module 3: Free Energy Principle
- Module 4: Generative Models
- Module 5: Policy Selection

Would you be able to provide more information about Joe's background and goals? This would help me tailor the remaining sections more specifically to his needs and create a more effective personalized curriculum.

Key questions:
1. What is Joe's mathematical/technical background?
2. What field does he work in?
3. What are his specific goals for learning Active Inference?
4. How much time can he dedicate to learning?
5. What is his preferred learning style?
