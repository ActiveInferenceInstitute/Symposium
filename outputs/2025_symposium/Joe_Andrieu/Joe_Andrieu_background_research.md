  - Works extensively on decentralized identity (DIDs), verifiable credentials, privacy-preserving identity systems.
  - Engages with AI integration in identity management and digital trust frameworks [6].
  
- **Methodological Overlap:**
  - Applies requirements engineering, conceptual modeling, and system design frameworks.
  - His work involves understanding human and system interactions, which could relate to computational neuroscience and Bayesian inference concepts foundational to Active Inference but remains at a systems and identity policy level rather than neuroscientific modeling [2][7].
  
- **Potential Applications to Active Inference:**
  - His work on identity control and privacy in AI contexts could inform human-agent interaction models in Active Inference systems.
  - The DID frameworks and requirements engineering could provide infrastructure for identity management in distributed cognitive systems.
  
- **Research Gaps Positioned to Address:**
  - Bridging human-centric identity requirements with AI-driven identity systems.
  - Formalizing identity control frameworks suitable for AI agents operating under probabilistic inference principles.
