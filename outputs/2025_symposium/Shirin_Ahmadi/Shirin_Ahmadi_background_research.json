Specific co-authors are not publicly highlighted.\n\n- **Recent Preprints**:  \n  No preprints or working papers on arXiv, bioRxiv, or similar repositories found for this individual.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Professional Experience\n\n- **Employment History**:  \n  - Postdoctoral Researcher, Tropical Pharmacology Lab, Technical University of Denmark (current)[1][4]  \n  - PhD collaboration between Eskisehir Osmangazi University and DTU (Turkey/Denmark)[1]\n\n- **Industry Experience**:  \n  No publicly available information on industry or consulting roles.\n\n- **Professional Affiliations and Societies**:  \n  No direct information on memberships or leadership roles in scientific societies found.\n\n- **Patents or Applied Work**:  \n  No patents or technical reports publicly associated.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Active Inference & Related Research\n\n- **Direct Connections**:  \n  Shirin Ahmadi’s self-reported background states a shift towards **Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle**, inspired by Karl Friston’s works. However, no direct publications or presentations explicitly linking her name with Active Inference in major repositories or conference proceedings are publicly found.\n\n- **Adjacent Fields**:  \n  Her expertise in complex systems, dynamic modeling, and biotechnology provides a strong interdisciplinary foundation relevant to **computational neuroscience** and **Bayesian inference** frameworks involved in Active Inference.\n\n- **Methodological Overlap**:  \n  Likely involves mathematical modeling and simulation, as suggested by her physics and biology background, but direct methodological papers applying these to Active Inference are unavailable.\n\n- **Potential Applications**:  \n  Focus on **emotion modeling, empathetic AI agents, and interoceptive systems** aligns with emerging trends in applying Active Inference to affective computing and adaptive AI[1].\n\n- **Research Gaps**:  \n  Her interdisciplinary approach could address gaps in bridging physics-based modeling with biological and AI systems under the Active Inference framework, but explicit published research addressing these is not found.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Academic & Professional Network\n\n- **Key Collaborators**:  \n  Collaborations with researchers at DTU and Eskisehir Osmangazi University are evident but unnamed publicly.\n\n- **Conference Presentations**:  \n  Participant in Active Inference Symposium; no public records of other presentations or talks found.\n\n- **Workshops or Community Engagement**:  \n  No evidence of organizing or leading workshops; no public blogs or tutorials identified.\n\n- **Social Media or Code Repositories**:  \n  No public GitHub or social media accounts linked to her professional work were found.\n\n---\n\n## 6.
