### 7. Future Potential & Opportunities

- **Emerging Research Directions:**
  - Continued work on topological insulators, superconductors, and novel quantum materials [7][8]
  - Potential to explore spintronics and magnetotransport phenomena with interdisciplinary applications

- **Opportunities within Active Inference Community:**
  - Given current focus, Nomura's expertise is outside mainstream Active Inference research domains; interdisciplinary collaboration could arise around modeling complex physical systems or materials, but no direct evidence yet

- **Potential Impact:**
  - High impact in condensed matter physics; potential cross-disciplinary impact if frameworks like Active Inference extend to physical systems modeling

- **Strategic Collaborations:**
  - Collaboration with computational neuroscientists or theorists exploring physical substrates of cognition could be a future opportunity but currently unreported
