After exhaustive multi-source web research, I found **very limited formal academic or institutional information** on Jim Freda consistent with the profile of an *independent scholar/practitioner* whose focus is on somatic anatomy and bodywork rather than conventional academic outputs. Here is a detailed profile with all verifiable findings, citations, and notes on data gaps.

### 1. Academic Background

- **Educational History:**  
  No publicly available records or profiles (e.g., LinkedIn, institutional pages, ORCID) indicate formal degrees, institutions, or graduation years for Jim Freda. This aligns with his self-identification as an *independent scholar/practitioner* rather than a traditional academic. No doctoral or university faculty affiliations were found.

- **Research Areas and Expertise Domains:**  
  Jim Freda specializes in *deep tissue bodywork, embodied anatomy, somatic history, and social theory*, focusing on the *myofascial anatomy* along the axial/postural core of the body, conceptualized as the *proprioceptive sensorimotor system*. He teaches this anatomy as a source of *somatic resilience*.  
  This is confirmed through his personal writings and public statements on his blog [threebonestheory.com](https://threebonestheory.com) and his active Substack [musclemonk.substack.com](https://substack.com/@musclemonk?r=2cl819&utm_medium=ios&utm_source=profile)[1].

- **Current and Past Academic Positions:**  
  No record of formal academic appointments or institutional faculty roles. He operates as an independent bodyworker and educator.

- **Notable Achievements, Awards, Grants, Honors:**  
  No publicly documented academic awards, grants, or honors could be found.

- **Academic Profile Pages:**  
  No Google Scholar, ResearchGate, or ORCID profiles were found under the name Jim Freda related to his described field. His digital presence is primarily via his blog and Substack.

- **Key Publications:**  
  There are no peer-reviewed journal publications, conference papers, or DOIs attributable to Jim Freda in academic databases (Google Scholar, ResearchGate, arXiv, PubMed).

- **Research Focus and Methodologies:**  
  His work is experiential and practice-based, grounded in *somatic bodywork*, *myofascial anatomy*, and *social theory* as it relates to embodiment. This is largely disseminated through essays, blog posts, and teaching rather than formal publications.

- **Citation Metrics:**  
  Not applicable due to absence of indexed academic publications.

### 4. Active Inference & Related Research

- **Direct Connections to Active Inference:**  
  Jim Freda is listed as a participant in the **Applied Active Inference Symposium** organized by the Active Inference Institute (Nov 13-15, 2024) [1]. However, no direct publications or presentations on active inference by him are publicly available.

- **Adjacent Fields (Free Energy Principle, Bayesian Inference, Computational Neuroscience):**  
  No evidence of formal research or publications in computational neuroscience or mathematical modeling related to active inference.

- **Methodological Overlap:**  
  His expertise in embodied anatomy and proprioceptive sensory-motor systems is conceptually related to embodied cognition and sensorimotor integration, which are relevant to active inference theory, but no direct methodological contributions to computational or mathematical active inference frameworks are documented.

- **Potential Applications:**  
  His somatic and proprioceptive expertise could inform embodied models of active inference by providing detailed anatomical and experiential insights into the body’s sensorimotor core, potentially enriching phenomenological or applied somatic approaches in active inference communities.

- **Research Gaps:**  
  He may address the gap between theoretical active inference models and lived embodied experience through somatic education, but no formal papers or projects are documented.

---

### 5. Academic & Professional Network

- **Collaborators:**  
  No identifiable academic collaborators or joint publications.

- **Conference Presentations:**  
  Listed as a participant in the Active Inference Institute Symposium (2024) [1], but no titles or abstracts of presentations were located.

- **Workshop Organization or Participation:**  
  No public evidence.

- **Community Engagement:**  
  Runs a Substack newsletter [musclemonk.substack.com](https://substack.com/@musclemonk?r=2cl819&utm_medium=ios&utm_source=profile) and a blog [threebonestheory.com](https://threebonestheory.com), where he publishes writings and teachings on somatic anatomy and bodywork.

- **Social Media Presence:**  
  No verified LinkedIn, Twitter/X, or ResearchGate profiles found under his name in relevant contexts.

### 7. Future Potential & Opportunities

- **Emerging Research Directions:**  
  Potential to integrate somatic, proprioceptive anatomy with active inference frameworks to enhance understanding of embodied cognition and sensorimotor resilience.

- **Growth Opportunities in Active Inference Community:**  
  His practical somatic expertise could complement computational and theoretical active inference research by grounding it in body-based experience and education, possibly fostering interdisciplinary collaboration between bodywork practitioners and neuroscientists.

- **Potential Impact:**  
  May help bridge the gap between theoretical active inference and applied somatic resilience training, offering novel embodied approaches.

- **Strategic Collaboration Opportunities:**  
  Collaborations with computational neuroscientists or philosophers of embodied cognition interested in the somatic basis of perception and action could be fruitful.

### Summary

Jim Freda is an **independent somatic scholar and bodyworker** whose work centers on the *myofascial anatomy of the proprioceptive sensorimotor system* as a foundation for somatic resilience. He is active online through his blog and Substack but lacks traditional academic credentials, publications, or indexed profiles. He is connected to the Active Inference community primarily as a symposium participant rather than a formal researcher. There is a clear niche for his embodied anatomical expertise to inform active inference theory and practice, but no formal academic outputs or collaborations are currently documented.
