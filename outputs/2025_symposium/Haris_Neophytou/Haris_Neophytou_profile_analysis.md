I apologize, but I don't see any specific information provided about Haris Neophytou's background, research interests, or current work in the prompt. Without this baseline information, I cannot provide a detailed analysis of their profile or make specific recommendations.

To provide a meaningful analysis, I would need information about:
- Their academic/professional background
- Current research interests and work
- Experience with Active Inference
- Specific goals for participating in the symposium
- Technical skills and domain expertise
- Current projects or applications
- Learning objectives

Once these details are provided, I can offer a comprehensive profile analysis addressing all the requested categories:
1. Expertise Assessment
2. Learning Opportunities
3. Research Interests Alignment
4. Collaboration Potential
5. Symposium Participation Strategy
6. Development Roadmap
7. Active Inference Integration

Would you be able to provide additional information about Haris Neophytou's background and current work? This would allow me to develop a more accurate and useful analysis.
