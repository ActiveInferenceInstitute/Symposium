I apologize, but I don't have enough information in the provided text to perform a complete analysis of Hongju Pae's profile. The input appears to be empty of specific details about this participant's background, interests, or goals.

To provide an accurate and helpful analysis, I would need information about:

- Their academic/professional background
- Current research interests
- Technical expertise
- Prior work related to Active Inference
- Specific goals for participating in the symposium
- Current challenges they're facing
- Future research or application interests

Without these details, any analysis would be speculative. I recommend:

1. **Gathering Basic Information**
   - Academic/professional background
   - Current role and research focus
   - Experience with Active Inference
   - Specific interests in the field

2. **Clarifying Goals**
   - What they hope to learn
   - Their intended applications
   - Research or practical objectives
   - Collaboration interests

3. **Understanding Needs**
   - Current knowledge gaps
   - Technical skills requirements
   - Resource needs
   - Support requirements

Once this information is available, I can provide a comprehensive profile analysis addressing all the requested categories.

Would you be able to provide additional information about Hongju Pae to enable a more detailed analysis?
