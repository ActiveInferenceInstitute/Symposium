Citation metrics (h-index, total citations) are unavailable due to the absence of publications. There is no evidence of collaborative networks, frequent co-authors, or research group affiliations.

## Professional Experience

No employment history, industry experience, consulting work, or leadership roles in professional organizations were identified. No evidence of patents, technical reports, or applied work was found. There are no listings on LinkedIn or similar professional networking sites under the name Hongju Pae with the provided ORCID.

## Active Inference & Related Research

## Future Potential & Opportunities

Given the absence of published work, online presence, or professional affiliations, it is not possible to identify emerging research directions, opportunities for growth in the Active Inference community, potential impact on the field, or strategic collaboration opportunities for Hongju Pae at this time.

## Summary of Findings

**Hongju Pae appears to have no verifiable academic or professional footprint in public databases, professional networks, or the scientific literature as of October 2025.** No publications, affiliations, employment history, or online presence were identified despite exhaustive multi-source searching. The ORCID profile exists but is empty. It is possible that Hongju Pae is an early-career researcher, uses a different name professionally, or has not yet published or established a public profile. Alternatively, the name or ORCID may be associated with private or unpublished work not accessible through standard academic channels.

If additional identifying information (e.g., institutional affiliation, alternative name spellings, geographic region) becomes available, a more targeted search may yield results. As of now, all major databases and professional networks return no matches for this individual.
