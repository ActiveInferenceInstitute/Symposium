I notice that several key pieces of information are missing from the participant profile (Background, Current Active Inference Application, Learning Needs, Challenges, and Pragmatic/Epistemic Value Sought). To create a truly personalized curriculum, I'll need these details about Hongju Pae.

However, I can outline a flexible framework that we can refine once we have more information:

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Proposed initial assessment meeting to understand:
  * Academic/professional background
  * Current understanding of probability theory and Bayesian inference
  * Programming experience (particularly Python/MATLAB)
  * Specific domain expertise and application interests
  * Learning style preferences

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
- To be customized based on assessment, but initially structured as:
  * Fundamentals of Bayesian inference
  * Free energy principle basics
  * Active inference core concepts
  * Application-specific modules (to be determined)

Would you be able to provide more information about Hongju Pae's:
1. Academic or professional background?
2. Current experience with Active Inference?
3. Specific learning objectives or goals?
4. Primary field of application?
5. Technical expertise level?
6. Time availability for learning?

This information would allow me to:
- Tailor the mathematical depth appropriately
- Select relevant application examples
- Determine appropriate programming exercises
- Structure the timeline realistically
- Choose suitable learning resources
- Design relevant practical exercises

Would you be able to provide any of these details so I can create a more targeted curriculum?
