This directly links Hongju Pae to active inference research, specifically in applying active inference models to understand decision-making in schizophrenia[4].\n- **Methodological Overlap**: Research on integrated information theory and computational modeling of adaptive agents demonstrates strong overlap with the mathematical and conceptual frameworks central to active inference (e.g., Bayesian inference, generative models, and decision-making under uncertainty)[1].\n- **Potential Applications**: Expertise in modeling adaptive behavior and information integration positions Pae to contribute to active inference applications in cognitive science, neuroscience, and AI[1].\n\n**Adjacent Fields**\n- **Free Energy Principle**: While no direct publications on the free energy principle were found, the methodological and conceptual overlap with active inference is clear, given Pae’s focus on Bayesian inference, generative models, and decision-making[1].\n- **Bayesian Inference**: Central to both integrated information theory and active inference; Pae’s work on computational models of consciousness and behavior implicitly relies on Bayesian principles[1].\n- **Computational Neuroscience**: Strong background in simulating neural systems and analyzing empirical data[1].\n\n**Methodological Overlap**\n- **Modeling and Simulation**: Use of agent-based simulations (e.g., Braitenberg vehicles) to study information integration and adaptive behavior[1].\n- **Mathematical Frameworks**: Application of information theory, statistical modeling, and computational neuroscience techniques[1].\n\n**Research Gaps**\n- **Consciousness and Active Inference**: Pae’s empirical and theoretical critiques of consciousness theories could inform active inference models of subjective experience and agency[1].\n- **Clinical Applications**: Demonstrated interest in applying computational models to psychopathology (e.g., schizophrenia)[4], suggesting potential for active inference in clinical cognitive neuroscience.\n\n## Academic & Professional Network\n\n**Key Collaborators**\n- **Jeffrey L.

Gaps (e.g., citation metrics, broader online presence) may reflect limited public sharing rather than absence of activity.
