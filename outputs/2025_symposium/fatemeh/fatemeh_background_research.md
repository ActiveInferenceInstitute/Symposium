## Metadata

- **participant**: fatemeh
- **report_type**: background_research

After exhaustive multi-source web and academic database searches (Google Scholar, ResearchGate, LinkedIn, ORCID, institutional websites, conference records, social media, and preprint servers), **there is no publicly available detailed information on an Active Inference Symposium participant named simply "fatemeh" with no additional identifying information such as last name, affiliation, ORCID, or background details**.

### Summary of Search Findings:

1. **Active Inference Symposium Participant Lists (2021-2025)**  
   - Official participant lists, programs, and speaker line-ups for the 1st to 5th Applied Active Inference Symposiums (2021-2025) do not disclose a participant named "fatemeh" without a last name or affiliation.  
   - The 2025 Symposium registration and program pages (Active Inference Institute) list multiple participants and presenters but no “fatemeh” identifiable by first name alone [1][6].

2. **Academic Databases and Profiles**  
   - Searches on Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID, and LinkedIn for “fatemeh” combined with keywords “Active Inference,” “computational neuroscience,” or “Bayesian inference” yield numerous individuals named Fatemeh but none clearly linked to Active Inference Symposium participation or notable activity in Active Inference research.  
   - No ORCID or institutional profile matching the criteria or linked to Active Inference was found under just the name "fatemeh."

3. **Conference Proceedings and Publications**  
   - Recent conference programs and proceedings related to Active Inference (e.g., Society for Mathematical Psychology, Computational Neuroscience meetings) do not list a “fatemeh” as author or presenter in Active Inference topics [2].  
   - No key publications or preprints authored by “fatemeh” specifically on Active Inference or related computational neuroscience topics were identified in arXiv, bioRxiv, or academic journals.

4. **Social Media and Online Presence**  
   - No relevant Twitter/X, GitHub, or personal web pages linked to an Active Inference researcher named “fatemeh” were found with connections to the symposium or Active Inference research.  
   - No blog posts, tutorials, or community engagement materials from a "fatemeh" related to Active Inference appeared in standard and niche academic social platforms.

### Implications and Next Steps

- **Name Insufficiency:** Searching only by the first name "fatemeh" without a surname or affiliation results in a highly ambiguous query, as "Fatemeh" is a common Persian female first name. Without a last name or institutional affiliation, it is effectively impossible to identify the correct individual among many academics named Fatemeh.

- **Recommendation:** To conduct a comprehensive profile, additional disambiguating information is essential, such as:
  - Full name (including surname)
  - Institutional affiliation(s)
  - ORCID iD or other unique researcher identifiers
  - Specific research area or recent publication titles
  - Links to prior presentations or social media handles

### Summary

At present, **no verifiable academic background, research contributions, professional experience, or Active Inference specific work related to a participant named only “fatemeh” at the Active Inference Symposium is publicly available**. The lack of identifiable data prevents further substantiated profiling.

If you can provide more identifying details, I can reinitiate a targeted in-depth investigation.
