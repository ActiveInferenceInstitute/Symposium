His expertise lies in practical AI application, data science methodologies including CRISP-DM, Python programming, data-driven decision-making, and digital innovation[5][6].\n\n- **Institutional Profile:** Greg Elliott is listed as a Senior Researcher and Lecturer at HZ University of Applied Sciences in the Department of ICT (Information and Communication Technology), with responsibilities including incoming exchange coordination for Data Science programs[3][5].\n\n- **Notable Roles:** Member of the Curriculum Oversight Board and ForHumanity Fellow focused on AI Compliance and audit criteria for the EU AI Act[4].\n\n- **Academic Profile Pages:** \n  - No dedicated Google Scholar or ORCID profiles publicly linked for this Greg Elliott at HZ.\n  - ResearchGate profiles or similar academic repository profiles could not be definitively matched.\n  - Institutional profile: [HZ University of Applied Sciences ICT Faculty](https://juc.nl/docenten/greg-elliott)[3]\n  - European Union Interoperable Europe Portal profile: [Greg Elliott - Interoperable Europe](https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/user/746534)[9]\n\n---\n\n### 2. Research Contributions\n\n- **Key Publications:** No direct academic journal publications or DOIs linked to Greg Elliott at HZ University of Applied Sciences were found in standard databases or Google Scholar. This may reflect a focus on applied research, teaching, and professional contributions rather than traditional academic publishing.\n\n- **Research Focus Areas:** His work centers on *AI Compliance-by-design*, *Knowledge Engineering*, and practical *Applied AI Ethics*, especially concerning regulatory frameworks such as the EU AI Act[4]. He is involved in AI audit criteria development and curriculum oversight for AI education.\n\n- **Methodologies:** Emphasizes applied AI methodologies, data science project management (CRISP-DM), Python programming, and digital innovation in ICT curricula[5][6].\n\n- **Collaborative Networks:** Active in AI compliance and ethics communities, including ForHumanity; the EU AI Act framework suggests collaboration with AI policy and compliance experts[4].\n\n- **Preprints or Working Papers:** None publicly available or indexed under his name for preprints such as arXiv or bioRxiv.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Professional Experience\n\n- **Employment History:** \n  - Lecturer and Senior Researcher in Data Science at HZ University of Applied Sciences, Netherlands (current)[2][3].\n  - No publicly available detailed prior employment history or dates beyond HZ listing.\n\n- **Industry Experience:** Active in AI compliance and audit frameworks, indicating involvement with AI governance and regulatory consulting, particularly for the EU AI Act[4].\n\n- **Professional Affiliations:** \n  - ForHumanity Fellow, contributing to AI compliance and ethical AI design frameworks[4].\n  - Member of Curriculum Oversight Board for AI-related education programs.\n\n- **Leadership Roles:** \n  - Curriculum oversight and leadership in AI compliance education.\n  - Incoming exchange coordinator for ICT/Data Science at HZ[5].\n\n- **Patents or Technical Reports:** No patents or technical reports located.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Active Inference & Related Research\n\n- **Direct Connections:** No explicit publications or presentations linking Greg Elliott (HZ) to Active Inference, free energy principle, or computational neuroscience were found.\n\n- **Adjacent Fields:** His expertise in AI compliance, knowledge engineering, and applied AI ethics overlaps methodologically with themes in Bayesian inference and AI governance, but no direct research contributions to Active Inference frameworks are evident[4].\n\n- **Methodological Overlap:** Practical AI development, data-driven decision making, and compliance auditing could interface with Active Inference modeling principles, especially in AI systems' explainability and regulatory adherence, but this remains speculative.\n\n- **Potential Applications:** His role in AI compliance and ethical AI education positions him to contribute to the responsible deployment of Active Inference-based AI systems in regulated environments.\n\n- **Research Gaps:** Opportunities exist for integrating Active Inference models with AI compliance frameworks, which Greg Elliott’s expertise in AI audit criteria could address.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Academic & Professional Network\n\n- **Key Collaborators:** Specific collaborators are not publicly listed. His involvement with ForHumanity and EU AI governance implies collaboration with AI policy experts and compliance engineers[4].\n\n- **Conference Presentations:** No records found of presentations specifically under his name in Active Inference or AI ethics conferences.\n\n- **Workshop Participation:** Participation in AI compliance workshops or curriculum boards mentioned[4].\n\n- **Community Engagement:** Coordinated coding activities for educational purposes at HZ (e.g., EU Code Week Scratch programming project)[7].\n\n- **Social Media Presence:** No active research-related Twitter or LinkedIn profile publicly linked to Greg Elliott at HZ. An email contact (elli0006@hz.nl) is available for outreach[7].\n\n---\n\n### 6.
