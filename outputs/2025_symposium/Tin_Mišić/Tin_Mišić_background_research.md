- **Methodological Overlap:**  
  Uses mathematical modeling, Bayesian dynamic optimization, and deep generative models in robotics simulations.

- **Potential Applications:**  
  The work has direct relevance for robotic perception systems that require selective attention to process high-dimensional sensory inputs efficiently, improving robot autonomy and adaptive behavior [4].

- **Research Gaps Addressed:**  
  The proposed model addresses the integration gap between active inference attention models and continuous sensory data with deep generative frameworks, which is under-explored in robotics applications [4].
