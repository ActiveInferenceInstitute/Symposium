Based on Tin Mišić's background in robotics and visual attention modeling, I'll create a personalized Active Inference curriculum that builds on their existing knowledge while addressing specific learning needs.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Strong understanding of computational implementations
- Experience with visual attention modeling
- Advanced mathematical background indicated by published work
- Gap areas: May benefit from broader toolset exposure and alternative frameworks

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Focus on robotics-specific implementations and advanced tools
Months 1-2: Advanced tools and frameworks
Months 3-4: Integration with existing research
Months 5-6: Novel applications and extensions

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
- Advanced Free Energy Principle applications in robotics
- Hierarchical active inference models
- Precision-weighted belief updating in robotic systems
- Integration with classical robotics control theory

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
- Implementation using PyAI and SPM
- Comparative analysis with existing attention models
- Integration with ROS (Robot Operating System)
- Development of custom active inference tools

5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**
- Multi-agent active inference systems
- Hierarchical deep active inference
- Stochastic optimal control and active inference
- Novel precision dynamics in robotics

6. **PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS**
- Extending visual attention models to robotic systems
- Real-time active inference implementation
- Scalability solutions for robotic applications
- Integration with existing robotics frameworks

7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**
- Connection with SPM and PyAI development teams
- Active inference robotics working groups
- Conference participation (IWAI, CCN)
- Research collaboration opportunities

8. **ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION**
- Implementation milestones
- Research output metrics
- Tool development goals
- Integration success measures

9. **RESOURCES AND TOOLS**
Recommended Reading:
- "Active Inference in Robotics" by Pezzulo et al.
- SPM documentation and tutorials
- PyAI documentation and examples
- Advanced ROS integration guides

Tools:
- PyAI
- SPM
- Custom robotics-specific active inference libraries
- ROS integration tools

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

Short-term (1-3 months):
- Evaluate and compare existing active inference tools
- Implement benchmark tests in robotics context
- Develop initial integration frameworks

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Create custom tools for robotics applications
- Extend visual attention model to robotic platforms
- Begin collaborative projects

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Develop novel active inference frameworks for robotics
- Contribute to tool development
- Publish implementation results

Given your existing expertise, this curriculum focuses on advanced applications and tool development rather than foundational concepts. The emphasis is on practical implementation and extension of active inference in robotics, building on your visual attention work.

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of this curriculum?
