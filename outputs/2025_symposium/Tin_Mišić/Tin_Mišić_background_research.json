Research Contributions\n\n- **Key Publications:**  \n  The most prominent publication is:\n\n  > Mišić, T., Koledić, K., Bonsignorio, F., Petrović, I., & Marković, I. (2025). *An Active Inference Model of Covert and Overt Visual Attention*. [PDF]. University of Zagreb Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing.  \n  > This paper models visual attention as an active inference process optimizing sensory precision to minimize free energy, tested in robotic and simulated visual tasks [4].\n\n- **Research Focus and Methodologies:**  \n  His research uses *active inference frameworks*, dynamic optimization of sensory precisions, and deep generative models to simulate attention mechanisms in robotics. Methodologies combine computational modeling, simulation, and robotics experiments with Bayesian inference concepts.\n\n- **Citation Metrics:**  \n  No citation metrics could be established due to the lack of a Google Scholar profile or indexed publications under his name. The available key paper appears recent (2025), limiting cumulative citations.\n\n- **Collaborative Networks:**  \n  Mišić has coauthored with researchers including Karlo Koledić, Fabio Bonsignorio, Ivan Petrović, and Ivan Marković, indicating a collaborative network spanning Croatian and possibly Japanese institutions [4].\n\n- **Recent Preprints / Working Papers:**  \n  No additional preprints or arXiv papers under his name were found. The visual attention model paper appears to be the central recent work.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

Active Inference & Related Research\n\n- **Direct Connections to Active Inference:**  \n  Mišić’s primary research is directly situated in active inference, with a focus on applying its principles to robotic visual attention [4]. His 2025 paper explicitly models covert and overt attention as an active inference process optimizing sensory precision.\n\n- **Adjacent Fields:**  \n  His work intersects with *free energy principle* (FEP), *Bayesian inference*, *computational neuroscience*, and robotics control theory. This aligns with the broader active inference research community focusing on perception-action cycles [4].\n\n- **Methodological Overlap:**  \n  Uses mathematical modeling, Bayesian dynamic optimization, and deep generative models in robotics simulations.\n\n- **Potential Applications:**  \n  The work has direct relevance for robotic perception systems that require selective attention to process high-dimensional sensory inputs efficiently, improving robot autonomy and adaptive behavior [4].\n\n- **Research Gaps Addressed:**  \n  The proposed model addresses the integration gap between active inference attention models and continuous sensory data with deep generative frameworks, which is under-explored in robotics applications [4].\n\n---\n\n## 5. Academic & Professional Network\n\n- **Key Collaborators:**  \n  Frequent coauthors include Karlo Koledić, Fabio Bonsignorio, Ivan Petrović, and Ivan Marković. These collaborators are associated with University of Zagreb and robotics/computational modeling groups [4].\n\n- **Conference Presentations:**  \n  No direct listings of conference talks or presentations by Mišić were found in major conference databases (e.g., ICRA 2025 program listings do not include him) [9].\n\n- **Workshops / Community Engagement:**  \n  No workshop organization or tutorials publicly linked to Mišić.\n\n- **Code Repositories / Tutorials:**  \n  The project page for *An Active Inference Model of Covert and Overt Visual Attention* is hosted [here](https://unizgfer-lamor.github.io/ainf-visual-attention/), indicating some public code or demonstration resources.\n\n- **Social Media Presence:**  \n  No verified Twitter/X, LinkedIn, or ResearchGate profiles found.\n\n---\n\n## 6.
