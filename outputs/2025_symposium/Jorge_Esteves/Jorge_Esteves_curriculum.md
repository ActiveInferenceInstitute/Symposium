I notice that several key pieces of information about Jorge Esteves are missing from the profile (Background, Current Active Inference Application, Learning Needs, Challenges, and Values Sought). To create a truly personalized curriculum, I'll need these details. However, I can outline a flexible framework that can be adjusted once we have more information.

**Initial Framework for Jorge Esteves:**

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Proposed Initial Assessment:
  * Technical background evaluation
  * Active Inference knowledge diagnostic test
  * Learning style assessment
  * Goals and objectives clarification interview

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH** (To be refined based on assessment)
Suggested Base Structure:
- Module 1: Foundations (4-6 weeks)
- Module 2: Core Theory (6-8 weeks)
- Module 3: Application Development (8-10 weeks)
- Module 4: Specialization (based on specific interests)

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
Base curriculum (to be tailored):
- Free Energy Principle fundamentals
- Bayesian inference basics
- Markov Decision Processes
- Variational inference
- Message passing algorithms

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
Initial practical framework:
- Python-based implementations
- Active Inference tutorials using PyAI
- Small-scale project development
- Code review sessions

Would you be able to provide more information about Jorge's:
1. Technical/academic background
2. Current work or research focus
3. Specific learning objectives
4. Main challenges they're facing
5. Intended applications of Active Inference

This would allow me to create a much more targeted and effective curriculum specifically for their needs.

In particular, knowing:
- Their mathematical background
- Programming experience
- Domain expertise
- Time availability
- Preferred learning style

Would help significantly in tailoring the remaining sections and creating a more detailed, personalized learning path.

Would you like to provide any of these details so I can refine this framework into a more specific curriculum for Jorge?
