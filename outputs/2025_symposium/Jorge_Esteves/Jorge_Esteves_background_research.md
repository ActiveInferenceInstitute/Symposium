### 4. Active Inference & Related Research

- **Direct Connections to Active Inference:**
  - No explicit publications or projects directly linking Jorge Esteves to active inference, free energy principle, or computational neuroscience found in the search results.
  - His work is primarily in osteopathic medicine and healthcare education, which does not overlap strongly with these computational neuroscience topics.
  
- **Adjacent Fields:**
  - While his expertise in healthcare and musculoskeletal systems may tangentially relate to neurosciences, no direct methodological overlap with active inference modeling was identified.
  
- **Methodological Overlap / Potential Applications:**
  - Potential for applying osteopathic clinical insights into computational frameworks like active inference exists but not documented in his current portfolio.
  
- **Research Gaps:**
  - Could explore integration of active inference with osteopathic treatment models or education methods, but no direct evidence of this yet.
