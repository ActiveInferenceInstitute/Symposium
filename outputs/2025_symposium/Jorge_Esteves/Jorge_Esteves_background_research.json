Active Inference & Related Research\n\n- **Direct Connections to Active Inference:**\n  - No explicit publications or projects directly linking Jorge Esteves to active inference, free energy principle, or computational neuroscience found in the search results.\n  - His work is primarily in osteopathic medicine and healthcare education, which does not overlap strongly with these computational neuroscience topics.\n  \n- **Adjacent Fields:**\n  - While his expertise in healthcare and musculoskeletal systems may tangentially relate to neurosciences, no direct methodological overlap with active inference modeling was identified.\n  \n- **Methodological Overlap / Potential Applications:**\n  - Potential for applying osteopathic clinical insights into computational frameworks like active inference exists but not documented in his current portfolio.\n  \n- **Research Gaps:**\n  - Could explore integration of active inference with osteopathic treatment models or education methods, but no direct evidence of this yet.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Academic & Professional Network\n\n- **Key Collaborators:**\n  - COME research group members [2][4].\n  - Collaborations with Oxford Brookes University researchers [1].\n  \n- **Conference Presentations:**\n  - Participated in osteopathic medicine conferences; specific titles and dates not found directly but inferred via COME activities.\n  \n- **Workshops & Community Engagement:**\n  - Leadership roles suggest involvement in workshops and academic events, particularly in osteopathy education.\n  \n- **Social Media & Online Engagement:**\n  - No active social media related to research (Twitter, GitHub) found.\n  - Mostly professional presence through institutional and journal platforms.\n\n---\n\n### 6.
