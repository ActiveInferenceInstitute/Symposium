I notice that several key fields about Binglin LYU's background, current Active Inference application, learning needs, challenges, and desired values are empty. To create a truly personalized and effective curriculum, I'll need more information about:

1. **Background:**
- Academic/professional background
- Current knowledge level in mathematics, programming, and cognitive science
- Prior exposure to related fields (e.g., Bayesian inference, machine learning)

2. **Current Active Inference Application:**
- Their intended use case
- Current projects or research interests
- Domain of application (e.g., neuroscience, robotics, AI)

3. **Learning Needs:**
- Specific skills they want to develop
- Time availability for learning
- Preferred learning methods

4. **Challenges:**
- Current obstacles in understanding/applying Active Inference
- Technical or conceptual difficulties
- Resource or time constraints

5. **Pragmatic/Epistemic Values:**
- Practical outcomes they hope to achieve
- Theoretical understanding they seek to develop
- Long-term goals in the field

Could you please provide these details so I can design a curriculum that:
- Matches their current knowledge level
- Addresses their specific challenges
- Aligns with their learning style
- Supports their practical goals
- Fits their time constraints
- Focuses on relevant applications

This information will help me create a truly personalized learning path rather than a generic curriculum.
