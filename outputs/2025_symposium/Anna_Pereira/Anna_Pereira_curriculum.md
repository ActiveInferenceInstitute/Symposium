I notice the background, current application, learning needs, challenges, and value sections are blank. To create a truly personalized curriculum for Anna Pereira, I'll need more information about:

1. Her academic/professional background
2. Current understanding/use of Active Inference
3. Specific learning objectives
4. Practical challenges she's facing
5. What she hopes to achieve (both practical and theoretical goals)

Could you provide these details so I can design a curriculum that:
- Matches her current knowledge level
- Addresses her specific challenges
- Aligns with her learning style
- Focuses on relevant applications
- Provides appropriate depth of mathematical/theoretical content
- Sets realistic timelines and milestones
- Recommends suitable resources and tools

Once you share this information, I can create a detailed, personalized curriculum following the structure you've outlined.
