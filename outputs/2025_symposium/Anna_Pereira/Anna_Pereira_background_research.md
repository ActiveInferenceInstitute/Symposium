## Academic Background

No verifiable academic information (degrees, institutions, graduation years, academic positions, or awards) was found for **Anna Pereira** affiliated with the Active Inference Institute (AII) or actincycle. Extensive searches across academic databases (Google Scholar, ResearchGate), institutional websites, and professional networks (LinkedIn, Twitter/X) did not yield any profiles, publication records, or institutional affiliations matching this name in the context of Active Inference, computational neuroscience, or related fields.

A YouTube video titled “Anna Pereira: ‘Research Fellow Update’” is associated with the Active Inference Institute, but it does not provide academic details or a speaker biography[2]. The video description links to the Active Inference Institute’s website and X (formerly Twitter) account, but these do not list Anna Pereira as a fellow, researcher, or team member as of this search[2].

**Notable absence:**  
There is no ORCID, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, LinkedIn, institutional, or personal website profile for Anna Pereira connected to AII or actincycle. No evidence of degrees, research areas, academic positions, awards, or honors was found in any academic database or institutional repository.

## Research Contributions

**No peer-reviewed publications, preprints, technical reports, or conference proceedings authored by Anna Pereira in the context of Active Inference, computational neuroscience, or adjacent fields were identified.** Searches of Google Scholar, ResearchGate, arXiv, bioRxiv, and major conference proceedings (e.g., COSYNE, NeurIPS, Active Inference workshops) returned no relevant results.

**Citation metrics:** Not applicable—no publication record found.

**Collaborative networks:** No evidence of research collaborations, frequent co-authors, or membership in research groups focused on Active Inference or related topics.

**Recent preprints and working papers:** None found.

## Professional Experience

**No verifiable employment history, industry experience, consulting work, professional affiliations, society memberships, leadership roles, patents, or applied work was identified for Anna Pereira in connection with AII, actincycle, or Active Inference.**  
Searches of LinkedIn, institutional employment directories, and professional society databases did not return any matching profiles.

## Active Inference & Related Research

**Direct connections to Active Inference:**  
The only direct evidence is Anna Pereira’s mention as a speaker in a YouTube video titled “Research Fellow Update” associated with the Active Inference Institute[2]. However, the video and its description do not provide details about her research, projects, or methodological contributions to Active Inference.

**Adjacent fields and methodological overlap:**  
No publications, presentations, or projects linking Anna Pereira to the free energy principle, Bayesian inference, computational neuroscience, or mathematical modeling in the context of Active Inference were found.

**Potential applications and research gaps:**  
In the absence of any published work or detailed professional background, it is not possible to assess potential applications of her expertise to Active Inference or identify research gaps she might address.

## Academic & Professional Network

**Key collaborators:** None identified.

**Conference presentations:**  
The only recorded presentation is the aforementioned YouTube video, which does not specify the conference, year, or content of the talk[2]. No other conference presentations, workshop participations, or proceedings listings were found.

**Workshop organization or participation:** No evidence found.

**Community engagement:**  
No blog posts, tutorials, code repositories, or other community contributions by Anna Pereira were identified.

**Social media presence:**  
No Twitter/X, LinkedIn, GitHub, or other social media profiles clearly linked to Anna Pereira in the context of Active Inference or actincycle were found.

There is no evidence to assess potential impact on the field of Active Inference or to suggest strategic collaboration opportunities at this time.

## Summary of Findings

- **Anna Pereira** is mentioned as a speaker in a YouTube video associated with the Active Inference Institute, but no academic, professional, or research profile could be verified through exhaustive web and database searches[2].
- **No degrees, institutional affiliations, publications, professional positions, or online profiles** were found that connect Anna Pereira to Active Inference, computational neuroscience, or related fields.
- **No evidence of research contributions, conference presentations beyond the single YouTube video, or community engagement** was identified.
- **Critical information gaps** exist regarding academic background, research focus, professional experience, and online presence. All available evidence is limited to the YouTube video, which provides no substantive biographical or research details[2].
