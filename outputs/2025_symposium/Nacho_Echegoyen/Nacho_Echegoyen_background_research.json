His methodological expertise in time series analysis, network inference, and machine learning positions him well for potential contributions to Active Inference, though there is no evidence of direct engagement with this field to date. His academic trajectory, publication record, and institutional roles indicate significant potential for impactful, interdisciplinary research at the intersection of network neuroscience and computational theories of brain function. Strategic collaboration with Active Inference groups could unlock new avenues for both basic and clinical neuroscience[1][2][3].",
