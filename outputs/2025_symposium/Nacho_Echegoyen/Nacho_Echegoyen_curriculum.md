I notice the background, current Active Inference application, learning needs, challenges, and pragmatic/epistemic value sections are empty. To create a truly personalized curriculum, I would need information about:

1. Their academic/professional background
2. Current understanding/use of Active Inference
3. Specific learning goals and needs
4. Challenges they're facing
5. What they hope to achieve (pragmatic value)
6. What they want to understand (epistemic value)

Would you like to provide these details so I can create a tailored curriculum? Or would you prefer I design a more general curriculum that can be refined once these details are available?

In either case, I can:
- Structure the learning path from foundational to advanced concepts
- Include both theoretical understanding and practical applications
- Incorporate multiple learning modalities (reading, computation, projects)
- Focus on real-world implementation
- Build in assessment and progress tracking

Please let me know which approach you'd prefer and provide any additional information available about the participant.
