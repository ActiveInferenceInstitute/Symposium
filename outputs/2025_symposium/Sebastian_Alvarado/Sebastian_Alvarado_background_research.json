Active Inference & Related Research\n\n- **Direct Connections to Active Inference**:  \n  No direct publications or presentations explicitly on Active Inference by Sebastian Alvarado were found. His research on neuroepigenetics and molecular plasticity in behavior could conceptually relate to Active Inference frameworks, particularly through understanding biological plasticity and adaptive behavior at molecular and cellular levels[3].\n\n- **Adjacent Fields**:  \n  His work touches on **computational neuroscience**, **neuroepigenetics**, and mechanisms that might integrate with **Bayesian inference** and **free energy principles** in theoretical neuroscience, but explicit applications or models in Active Inference are not documented[3][5].\n\n- **Methodological Overlap**:  \n  Primarily experimental cell and molecular biology techniques, epigenomics, and behavioral assays rather than computational modeling or mathematical frameworks typical of Active Inference research.\n\n- **Potential Applications to Active Inference**:  \n  Understanding epigenetic mechanisms that modulate neuronal function and behavior offers a valuable biological substrate that could inform or complement Active Inference models of brain function.\n\n- **Research Gaps**:  \n  Bridging molecular epigenetic plasticity and computational theories like Active Inference is an emerging interdisciplinary challenge where his expertise could contribute[3].\n\n---\n\n### 5. Academic & Professional Network\n\n- **Key Collaborators**:  \n  - Lab members and co-authors listed on the [Alvarado Lab website](https://www.alvaradolab.com/team) include graduate students and postdocs at CUNY[5].  \n  - Collaborations with researchers in neuroepigenetics and evolutionary biology at McGill and CUNY are likely.\n\n- **Conference Presentations**:  \n  No specific listings found for Active Inference or related conferences, but likely participates in neuroscience and epigenetics meetings.\n\n- **Workshops & Community Engagement**:  \n  No public records of workshop organization or blog posts/tutorials.\n\n- **Social Media Related to Research**:  \n  No verified Twitter/X or similar professional social media accounts directly linked to research found.\n\n---\n\n### 6.
