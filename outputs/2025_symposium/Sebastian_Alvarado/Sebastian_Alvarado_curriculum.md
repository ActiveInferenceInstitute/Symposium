Based on Sebastian's background in neuroepigenomics and social behavior, I'll design a curriculum that bridges Active Inference with molecular and behavioral biology while addressing his specific needs.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Strong background in molecular biology and behavior
- Limited exposure to computational modeling
- Need for translating Active Inference concepts to biology audience
- Learning style likely empirical and experiment-focused

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Months 1-2: Foundations
- Active Inference basics through biological analogies
- Cellular decision-making as inference
- Gene regulation networks as generative models
- Simple computational tools introduction

Months 3-4: Application Development
- Experimental design incorporating Active Inference
- Small-scale pilot studies
- Tool implementation
- Communication strategies

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
Biology-Centric Introduction:
- Homeostasis as active inference
- Cellular behavior as Bayesian inference
- Gene regulatory networks and free energy
- Social behavior through the lens of inference

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
Practical Projects:
- Design small-scale experiment using existing lab equipment
- Analyze behavioral data using Active Inference framework
- Simple computational modeling using Python/MATLAB
- Pilot study on epigenetic regulation as active inference

5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**
Specialized Applications:
- Active Inference in gene regulation
- Social behavior modeling
- Multi-scale biological systems
- Integration with epigenetic mechanisms

6. **PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS**
Immediate Lab Applications:
- Reframe existing experiments through Active Inference
- Design low-cost behavioral experiments
- Develop analysis pipelines
- Create visualization tools

7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**
Networks:
- Connect with computational biology groups
- Join Active Inference biology working groups
- Develop interdisciplinary collaborations
- Share tools and protocols

8. **ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION**
Milestones:
- Complete basic computational modeling tutorial
- Design first Active Inference experiment
- Present work to lab group
- Submit conference abstract

9. **RESOURCES AND TOOLS**
Recommended:
- "Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior"
- SPM software package
- Python-based modeling tools
- Online tutorials specific to biological systems

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

Short-term (1-3 months):
- Master basic Active Inference concepts
- Identify potential experiments in current lab setup
- Develop communication strategy for lab members

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Run pilot experiment
- Analyze existing data using Active Inference framework
- Build computational skills

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Integrate Active Inference into regular lab practices
- Develop new experimental paradigms
- Submit paper combining Active Inference with epigenetics

Specific Experiment Suggestion:
Consider a low-cost experiment studying social behavior in model organisms (e.g., fruit flies) through an Active Inference lens, measuring behavioral adaptations to environmental changes while monitoring simple epigenetic markers. This would combine existing lab capabilities with new theoretical frameworks.

This curriculum emphasizes practical application while building theoretical understanding, with a focus on experiments that can be implemented with existing lab resources. It addresses Sebastian's need to explain concepts to others in his discipline and identifies concrete ways to apply Active Inference in his research.
