I notice that several key pieces of information about Frank Holzkamp are missing from the provided background. To create a truly personalized and effective curriculum, I'll need details about:

1. Frank's background (academic/professional experience)
2. Current Active Inference application (if any)
3. Specific learning needs
4. Challenges they're facing
5. Their pragmatic and epistemic goals

Would you be able to provide these details? Once you do, I can create a highly tailored curriculum that:

- Matches their current knowledge level
- Addresses their specific challenges
- Aligns with their learning style
- Focuses on their intended applications
- Meets both their practical and theoretical goals

In the meantime, I can outline a flexible framework that we can adjust once we have more information:

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Initial diagnostic assessment focusing on:
  * Mathematical background
  * Programming experience
  * Prior exposure to Bayesian inference
  * Domain expertise
  * Learning preferences

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
- Adaptable modules that can be calibrated to:
  * Technical vs. conceptual emphasis
  * Application-specific focus
  * Preferred learning pace
  * Available time commitment

Would you like to provide more information about Frank so I can create a fully personalized curriculum?
