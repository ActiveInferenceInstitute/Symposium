I notice that the background, current Active Inference application, learning needs, challenges, and pragmatic/epistemic values are not provided for Frank Holzkamp. To create a truly personalized curriculum, I'll need those details.

However, I can outline how I would approach creating this curriculum once those details are provided:

**Initial Response:**
"To design a properly personalized curriculum for Frank, I'll need some additional information about:
- His academic/professional background
- Current understanding/use of Active Inference
- Specific learning objectives
- Practical challenges he's facing
- What he hopes to achieve (pragmatic value)
- What he wants to understand (epistemic value)

Would you be able to provide these details? This will help me tailor the curriculum to:
1. Start at the right level
2. Focus on relevant applications
3. Address specific challenges
4. Align with his goals
5. Use appropriate learning methods

In the meantime, I can explain how I would customize each section of the curriculum based on different potential backgrounds and needs. Would you like me to:
1. Outline a general Active Inference curriculum that we can then personalize?
2. Explain how I would modify each section based on different learner profiles?
3. Create multiple curriculum pathways for different typical use cases?

Please let me know which would be most helpful, and provide any additional information about Frank that would help me tailor this curriculum specifically to his needs."

This approach ensures we create a truly personalized learning experience rather than a one-size-fits-all solution.
