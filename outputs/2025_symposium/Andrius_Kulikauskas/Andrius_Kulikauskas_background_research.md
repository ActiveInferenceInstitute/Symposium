## 4. Active Inference & Related Research

- **Direct Connections:**
  - No explicit publications or projects titled under "Active Inference" or "Free Energy Principle."
  - However, his work on *mathematical languages of wisdom* and *foundational mathematical modeling* suggests potential methodological overlap with computational neuroscience and Bayesian inference frameworks common in Active Inference literature.

- **Adjacent Fields:**
  - Research explores deep mathematical and philosophical questions, which could conceptually connect to Active Inference’s focus on perception, cognition, and prediction.
  - His interest in logic, foundational math, and epistemology may provide unique perspectives on the theoretical underpinnings of Active Inference.

- **Methodological Overlap:**
  - Uses mathematical frameworks and modeling approaches, but no direct evidence of computational simulation or neuroscientific modeling typical of Active Inference.
  - Philosophical exploration of knowledge and wisdom may complement cognitive science approaches [4](https://www.math4wisdom.com/wiki/Exposition/AndriusKulikauskas).

- **Potential Applications:**
  - His integrative approach to wisdom and truth could enrich theoretical frameworks in Active Inference, particularly in the semantics of meaning and decision-making under uncertainty.

- **Research Gaps Addressed:**
  - Bridges gaps between abstract mathematical philosophy and practical wisdom, potentially offering new conceptual tools for Active Inference research.
