Active Inference & Related Research\n\n- **Direct Connections:**\n  - No explicit publications or projects titled under \"Active Inference\" or \"Free Energy Principle.\"\n  - However, his work on *mathematical languages of wisdom* and *foundational mathematical modeling* suggests potential methodological overlap with computational neuroscience and Bayesian inference frameworks common in Active Inference literature.\n\n- **Adjacent Fields:**\n  - Research explores deep mathematical and philosophical questions, which could conceptually connect to Active Inference’s focus on perception, cognition, and prediction.\n  - His interest in logic, foundational math, and epistemology may provide unique perspectives on the theoretical underpinnings of Active Inference.\n\n- **Methodological Overlap:**\n  - Uses mathematical frameworks and modeling approaches, but no direct evidence of computational simulation or neuroscientific modeling typical of Active Inference.\n  - Philosophical exploration of knowledge and wisdom may complement cognitive science approaches [4](https://www.math4wisdom.com/wiki/Exposition/AndriusKulikauskas).\n\n- **Potential Applications:**\n  - His integrative approach to wisdom and truth could enrich theoretical frameworks in Active Inference, particularly in the semantics of meaning and decision-making under uncertainty.\n\n- **Research Gaps Addressed:**\n  - Bridges gaps between abstract mathematical philosophy and practical wisdom, potentially offering new conceptual tools for Active Inference research.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Academic & Professional Network\n\n- **Key Collaborators:**\n  - Informal network of independent thinkers; no formal co-authorships or institutional collaborations publicly documented.\n  - Mentions of engagement with thinkers like John Baez and international philosophy communities [1](https://www.math4wisdom.com/wiki/Research/AndriusKulikauskas).\n\n- **Conference Presentations:**\n  - Delivered 40+ talks including at:\n    - World Congress of Philosophy (3 talks)\n    - World Congress of Universal Logic (3 talks) [1](https://www.math4wisdom.com/wiki/Research/AndriusKulikauskas).\n\n- **Workshops & Community Engagement:**\n  - Organizer of Minčių sodas, a vibrant online think tank (1998-2010).\n  - Math 4 Wisdom community serves as an ongoing investigatory and discussion forum [3](https://www.math4wisdom.com).\n\n- **Public Outreach:**\n  - Active in cultural advocacy relating to Lithuanian Jewish history and human rights.\n  - Offers public talks, blog posts, and educational videos [5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72obOdV9qsA).\n\n- **Social Media Related to Research:**\n  - Mathstodon profile: [@AndriusKulikauskas](https://mathstodon.xyz/@AndriusKulikauskas) [2](https://mathstodon.xyz/@AndriusKulikauskas).\n\n---\n\n## 6.
