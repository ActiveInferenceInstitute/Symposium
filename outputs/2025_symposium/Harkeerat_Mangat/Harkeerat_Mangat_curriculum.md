Based on Harkeerat's background in Cognitive Science and specific interest in applying Active Inference to film fMRI and time perception, I'll design a personalized curriculum that bridges neuroscience with Active Inference principles.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Current Strengths:
  * Strong background in cognitive neuroscience
  * Experience with fMRI and dynamic functional connectivity
  * Academic research environment with direct access to Active Inference expertise
- Knowledge Gaps:
  * Formal mathematical foundations of Active Inference
  * Computational implementation
  * Application to time perception specifically

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**
Short-term (1-3 months):
- Master foundational mathematics
- Complete basic Active Inference tutorials
