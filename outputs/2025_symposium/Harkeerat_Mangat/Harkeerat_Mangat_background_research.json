Active Inference & Related Research\n\n- **Direct Links to Active Inference**:\n  - Mangat's master's thesis is supervised by Ronald Sladky, who is a cognitive neuroscientist and Active Inference instructor at University of Vienna, indicating direct academic engagement with Active Inference theory and methods[1].\n  - No direct publications by Mangat explicitly on Active Inference found, but close academic environment and thesis topic suggest methodological overlap.\n  \n- **Adjacent Fields**:\n  - Cognitive neuroscience, Bayesian inference, dynamic functional connectivity, and computational modeling in fMRI.\n  - Use of deep learning and visual analytics intersecting with computational neuroscience.\n  \n- **Methodological Overlap**:\n  - Dynamic functional connectivity and naturalistic fMRI are compatible with Active Inference frameworks emphasizing brain dynamics and prediction errors.\n  \n- **Potential Applications**:\n  - Mangat’s work on comparing dynamic functional connectivity methods could enhance understanding of neurocomputational mechanisms underlying Active Inference in naturalistic brain states.\n  \n- **Research Gaps**:\n  - Bridging methodological gaps between dynamic connectivity analyses and Active Inference models.\n  - Developing visualization tools for interpretability of complex brain models, which Mangat’s recent publication suggests a focus on.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Academic & Professional Network\n\n- **Key Collaborators**:\n  - Ronald Sladky (University of Vienna) – supervisor and Active Inference mentor[1].\n  - MEi:CogSci student network including Comenius University, University of Ljubljana, and Eötvös Loránd University[2].\n  \n- **Conference Presentations**:\n  - Presented at MEi:CogSci Conference 2024 in Bratislava: “Knowledge-Driven Visual Analytics in Deep Learning”[1][3].\n  \n- **Workshop Participation / Organization**:\n  - No records found of organizing activities.\n  \n- **Community Engagement**:\n  - No public blog posts, tutorials, or code repositories found explicitly linked to Mangat.\n  \n- **Social Media**:\n  - No public research-related social media profiles identified.\n\n---\n\n## 6.
