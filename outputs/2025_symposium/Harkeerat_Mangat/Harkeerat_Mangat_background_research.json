Vienna [Self-report, 2025].\n- His master’s thesis on dynamic functional connectivity in naturalistic fMRI is directly relevant to Active Inference, which seeks to model brain dynamics using Bayesian principles [Self-report, 2025].\n- He presented at the MEi:CogSci Conference 2024, where Active Inference was a key theme, including a plenary talk by Ronald Sladky on the amygdaloid complex from an Active Inference perspective [1].\n\n### Adjacent Fields\n\n- **Free Energy Principle**: Active Inference is grounded in the Free Energy Principle, which Mangat’s work implicitly engages with through dynamic connectivity and Bayesian modeling [Self-report, 2025].\n- **Bayesian Inference**: His research on knowledge-driven visual analytics and dynamic connectivity aligns with Bayesian approaches to brain function [3].\n- **Computational Neuroscience**: His work bridges computational modeling and empirical neuroscience, particularly in the context of fMRI and brain network analysis [Self-report,
