  "content": "Given the extensive requirements for researching Harkeerat Mangat, the available information is limited but can be summarized as follows:\n\n## Academic Background\n\n- **Educational History**: Harkeerat Mangat studied fine art at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf under Christopher Williams and Dhrupad with Pt. Uday Bhawalkar in Pune, India. Currently, he is pursuing a master's degree in Cognitive Science at the University of Vienna, where he is writing a thesis on dynamic functional connectivity methods for naturalistic fMRI under the supervision of Ronald Sladky[1][2].\n- **Research Areas**: His research focuses on cognitive science, particularly dynamic functional connectivity in fMRI, and its applications in understanding brain function[1][2].\n- **Institutional Affiliations**: He is affiliated with the University of Vienna[1][2].\n\n## Research Contributions\n\n- **Publications**: There are no specific publications listed in the available sources. However, his work involves engaging with cognitive science paradigms through art, such as the 4E paradigm[5].\n- **Research Focus**: His research involves cognitive science methodologies, particularly in the context of naturalistic fMRI and dynamic functional connectivity[1][2].\n- **Collaborative Networks**: Information on frequent co-authors or research groups is not available.\n\n## Professional Experience\n\n- **Employment History**: Specific employment details are not provided in the available sources.\n- **Professional Affiliations**: No information is available on professional affiliations or society memberships.\n\n## Active Inference & Related Research\n\n- **Direct Connections**: While specific publications on Active Inference are not listed, his work under Ronald Sladky, who teaches Active Inference, suggests a connection to this field[1][2].\n- **Adjacent Fields**: His engagement with cognitive science paradigms, such as the 4E paradigm, indicates potential overlap with fields like Bayesian inference and computational neuroscience[5].\n- **Methodological Overlap**: His use of fMRI and dynamic functional connectivity methods suggests overlap with modeling and simulation techniques[1][2].\n\n## Academic & Professional Network\n\n- **Key Collaborators**: Information on key collaborators is not available.\n- **Conference Presentations**: Specific conference presentations are not detailed in the available sources.\n\n## Online Presence & Resources\n\n- **Personal Website**: Not available.\n- **Google Scholar Profile**: Not available.\n- **ResearchGate Profile**: Not available.\n- **LinkedIn Profile**: Not available.\n- **GitHub or Code Repositories**: Not available.\n- **Twitter/X or Social Media**: Not available.\n- **ORCID Profile**: Not available.\n- **Institutional Profile Page**: [University of Vienna](https://cognitivescience.univie.ac.at).\n- **Videos/Podcasts/Interviews**: A video titled *Big Babies* (2024) is mentioned, which engages with cognitive science paradigms[5].\n\n## Future Potential & Opportunities\n\n- **Emerging Research Directions**: His work in dynamic functional connectivity and engagement with cognitive science paradigms suggests potential for future research in these areas[1][2].\n- **Opportunities for Growth**: Participation in the Active Inference community and collaboration with cognitive neuroscientists could provide opportunities for growth[1][2].\n\n### References\n\n1.
