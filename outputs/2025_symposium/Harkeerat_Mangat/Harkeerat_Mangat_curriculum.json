  "content": "Based on Harkeerat's background in Cognitive Science and specific interest in applying Active Inference to film fMRI and time perception, I'll design a personalized curriculum that bridges neuroscience with Active Inference principles.\n\n1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**\n- Current Strengths:\n  * Strong background in cognitive neuroscience\n  * Experience with fMRI and dynamic functional connectivity\n  * Academic research environment with direct access to Active Inference expertise\n- Knowledge Gaps:\n  * Formal mathematical foundations of Active Inference\n  * Computational implementation\n  * Application to time perception specifically\n- Learning Style:\n  * Academic/research-oriented\n  * Preference for theoretical foundations with practical applications\n\n2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**\nMonth 1-2: Foundations\n- Basic principles of Free Energy Principle\n- Markov Blankets and generative models\n- Relationship between Active Inference and predictive coding\n\nMonth 3-4: Computational Implementation\n- Variational Bayes\n- Message passing algorithms\n- SPM12 software environment\n\nMonth 5-6: Specialized Applications\n- Time perception models\n- Naturalistic stimulus processing\n- Film neuroimaging applications\n\n3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**\n- Module 1: Mathematical Foundations\n  * Variational free energy\n  * Bayesian inference\n  * Hierarchical generative models\n\n- Module 2: Neuroscientific Framework\n  * Predictive coding in the brain\n  * Hierarchical processing\n  * Temporal integration\n\n- Module 3: Time Perception\n  * Internal models of time\n  * Temporal inference\n  * Cinematographic perception\n\n4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**\n- Computational Projects:\n  * Implementation of basic Active Inference models in MATLAB\n  * SPM12 tutorials for fMRI analysis\n  * Custom scripts for temporal modeling\n\n- Practical Exercises:\n  * Analysis of naturalistic fMRI data\n  * Implementation of time perception experiments\n  * Model comparison and validation\n\n5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**\n- Dynamic Causal Modeling\n- Temporal perception in continuous stimuli\n- Multi-scale modeling of narrative processing\n- Integration with existing fMRI analysis methods\n\n6. **PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS**\n- Case Study Focus:\n  * Film perception studies\n  * Temporal integration in narrative processing\n  * Dynamic connectivity during naturalistic viewing\n\n- Implementation Strategies:\n  * Experimental design for film fMRI\n  * Model specification for temporal processing\n  * Integration with existing analysis pipelines\n\n7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**\n- Join Active Inference Institute\n- Participate in MIND 2024 conference\n- Connect with film neuroscience researchers\n- Engage with SPM/Active Inference forums\n\n8. **ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION**\nMilestones:\n- Basic model implementation (Month 2)\n- First temporal model (Month 4)\n- Preliminary PhD proposal (Month 6)\n\n9. **RESOURCES AND TOOLS**\nEssential Reading:\n- \"Active Inference\" by Da Costa et al.\n- \"A Step-by-Step Tutorial on Active Inference\" by Ramstead et al.\n- Key papers on temporal processing and film perception\n\nTools:\n- MATLAB\n- SPM12\n- Active Inference toolbox\n- Python (optional)\n\n10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**\nShort-term (1-3 months):\n- Master foundational mathematics\n- Complete basic Active Inference tutorials\n- Begin experimental design\n\nMedium-term (3-6 months):\n- Implement first temporal models\n- Analyze pilot data\n- Draft PhD proposal\n\nLong-term (6-12 months):\n- Complete preliminary studies\n- Present at conferences\n- Begin PhD program\n\nThis curriculum emphasizes the bridge between traditional fMRI analysis and Active Inference while focusing on temporal aspects of film perception. It's designed to build towards a PhD proposal while maintaining practical applicability to current research.",
