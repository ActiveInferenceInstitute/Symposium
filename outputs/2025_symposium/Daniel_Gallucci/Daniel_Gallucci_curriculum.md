Based on Daniel's background in osteopathy, clinical neuroscience, and developmental biology, I'll design a curriculum focused on clinical applications of Active Inference for brain rehabilitation.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Strong foundation in clinical neuroscience and developmental biology
- Understanding of biological systems and hierarchical organization
- Likely familiar with dynamical systems and homeostatic processes
- May need development in mathematical formalization and computational aspects
- Learning style likely favors clinical/practical applications with biological grounding

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Foundations (1-2 months):
- Biological interpretations of Free Energy Principle
- Homeostatic regulation through Active Inference
- Neural implementations of predictive processing
- Clinical relevance to rehabilitation

Progressive Development (2-4 months):
