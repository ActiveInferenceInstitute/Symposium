Based on Anastassiya's background in data science and computational neuroscience, and her transition from industry to academia, I'll design a personalized Active Inference curriculum that bridges computational and theoretical aspects while focusing on research applications.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Strengths: Strong computational background, familiarity with neural computation
- Assumed knowledge: Statistical methods, machine learning, programming
- Initial focus: Building theoretical foundations while leveraging existing technical skills
- Learning style: Likely analytical and implementation-oriented based on background

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
