## Academic Background

**Degrees, Institutions, and Graduation Years**  
No direct evidence of Anastassiya Yegarmina's academic degrees, institutions, or graduation years was found in the available search results or via supplementary searches of major academic databases, institutional websites, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, LinkedIn, or ORCID. The user-provided information notes a preparation for a PhD in computational neuroscience, but no independent verification or details (such as MSc, BSc, or enrollment dates) are available in open sources.

**Research Areas and Expertise**  
According to the user-provided background, Anastassiya Yegarmina’s expertise spans data science and computational neuroscience, with a transition from industry to academia. However, no peer-reviewed publications, preprints, or conference proceedings directly attributed to her under this name were found in the search results or in supplementary searches of Google Scholar, ResearchGate, arXiv, or institutional repositories. Her name appears only once in the academic literature as a co-author on a working paper, but without further details about her role or contributions[1].

**Current and Past Academic Positions**  
No evidence of current or past academic positions (e.g., postdoctoral researcher, lecturer, research assistant) at any institution was found. There are no institutional profile pages or faculty listings that mention her.

**Notable Achievements, Awards, Grants, Honors**  
No announcements of awards, grants, honors, or notable achievements were found in the available sources.

**Academic Profile Pages**  
No Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID, or institutional profile pages were found under the name Anastassiya Yegarmina. Searches on these platforms returned no results matching her name and research interests.

## Research Contributions

**Key Publications**  
Anastassiya Yegarmina is listed as a co-author on the working paper:  
**“Regional Foresight for Bridging National Science, Technology and Innovation with Company Innovation: Experiences from Russia”**, HSE Working Papers, WP BRP 29/STI/2014, National Research University Higher School of Economics, 2017, with Sergey Kortov, Dmitry Shulgin, Dmitrii Tolmachev, and Anastassiya Yegarmina[1].  
However, no full text, abstract, or DOI for this paper is available in the search results or via open-access repositories. There are no other publications, preprints, or technical reports attributed to her in major databases.

**Research Focus Areas and Methodologies**  
Given the single co-authorship on a foresight and innovation policy paper, her direct involvement in computational neuroscience or data science research cannot be confirmed from available sources. The working paper’s focus is on regional innovation systems and technology foresight, not computational neuroscience or data science[1].

**Citation Metrics**  
No citation metrics (h-index, total citations) are available, as no Google Scholar or ResearchGate profile exists.

**Collaborative Networks**  
Her only identifiable co-authors are Sergey Kortov, Dmitry Shulgin, and Dmitrii Tolmachev, based on the 2017 working paper[1]. No evidence of ongoing collaborations, research groups, or joint projects in computational neuroscience or data science was found.

**Recent Preprints and Working Papers**  
No recent preprints (e.g., on arXiv, bioRxiv) or working papers were found.

## Professional Experience

**Employment History**  
No verifiable employment history, industry roles, or consulting work was found in the available sources or on professional networks such as LinkedIn.

**Professional Affiliations and Society Memberships**  
No memberships in professional societies (e.g., Society for Neuroscience, IEEE, INCF) were found.

**Leadership Roles**  
No evidence of leadership roles in professional organizations.

**Patents, Technical Reports, or Applied Work**  
No patents, technical reports, or applied industry work were found.

## Active Inference & Related Research

**Direct Connections to Active Inference**  
No publications, presentations, or projects directly related to Active Inference, the free energy principle, or Bayesian inference in neuroscience were found.

**Adjacent Fields and Methodological Overlap**  
No evidence of work in computational neuroscience, Bayesian modeling, or related methodologies was found beyond the user-provided background.

**Potential Applications and Research Gaps**  
Based on the available information, there is no evidence that Anastassiya Yegarmina has published or presented work that directly applies to Active Inference. Any potential to address research gaps in this field is speculative and not supported by current public records.

## Academic & Professional Network

**Key Collaborators**  
Only the co-authors from the 2017 working paper are confirmed: Sergey Kortov, Dmitry Shulgin, and Dmitrii Tolmachev[1]. No other collaborators in computational neuroscience or data science were identified.

**Conference Presentations**  
No records of conference presentations, workshop participation, or organization were found.

**Community Engagement**  
No blog posts, tutorials, code repositories (GitHub), or other community engagement activities were found.

**Social Media Presence**  
No Twitter/X, LinkedIn, or other social media profiles were found under this name that are clearly associated with computational neuroscience or data science research.

## Online Presence & Resources

## Future Potential & Opportunities

**Emerging Research Directions**  
No recent publications or preprints suggest emerging research directions in computational neuroscience or Active Inference.

**Opportunities for Growth in Active Inference Community**  
There is no public evidence of current engagement with the Active Inference community. Opportunities for future involvement would depend on establishing a visible research track record in relevant areas.

**Potential Impact on the Field**  
No evidence of impact on computational neuroscience or Active Inference is available.

**Strategic Collaboration Opportunities**  
No evidence of strategic collaborations or networks in the target research areas was found.

## Summary of Findings

- **Anastassiya Yegarmina** is listed as a co-author on a single working paper in innovation policy, but no further academic or professional details are publicly available[1].
- **No evidence** of academic degrees, institutional affiliations, employment history, or professional memberships was found.
- **No publications, preprints, or presentations** in computational neuroscience, data science, or Active Inference were found.
- **No online profiles** (Google Scholar, ResearchGate, LinkedIn, ORCID, GitHub, Twitter/X) or institutional pages were identified.
- **No community engagement** (blogs, tutorials, code) or conference activity was found.
