- **Strategic Collaboration:**  
  Collaborations with neuroscience or computational modeling groups could be promising if research focus shifts accordingly.

---

### Summary

- The only verifiable trace of Anastassiya Yegarmina is as a co-author on a 2017 paper on **regional foresight and innovation systems** in Russia, with no direct publicly available research output or profiles in computational neuroscience, data science, or active inference domains[1].
- No academic or professional profiles, publications, or social media presence related to active inference or computational neuroscience could be found.
- This suggests either the researcher is early in academic career, transitioning from industry with limited public footprint, or using a different professional name online.
- Further information may require direct inquiry through symposium organizers or personal contact.
