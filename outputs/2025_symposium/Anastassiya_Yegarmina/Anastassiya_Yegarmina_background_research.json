  "content": "After an exhaustive multi-source web search across academic databases, professional profiles, publication repositories, conference proceedings, and social media platforms, **there is limited publicly available information specifically on Anastassiya Yegarmina** as an individual researcher or professional in computational neuroscience or data science shifting from industry to academia. Below is a detailed account of findings and the investigative results structured according to your requested categories, along with limitations and inferred conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Academic Background\n\n- **Educational History:**  \n  No verifiable records or public mentions of Anastassiya Yegarminaâ€™s degrees, institutions, or graduation years were found in academic databases such as Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID, institutional websites, or LinkedIn profiles.\n\n- **Research Areas and Expertise:**  \n  Based on a co-authored work appearing in a 2017 publication in the domain of technology foresight and innovation systems, Anastassiya Yegarmina appears associated with topics related to **science and technology foresight, innovation forecasting, and technology trends analysis** rather than core computational neuroscience or data science per se[1].\n\n- **Academic Positions:**  \n  No current or past academic institutional profiles or positions were located.\n\n- **Notable Achievements, Awards, Grants:**  \n  None publicly documented.\n\n- **Academic Profile Pages:**  \n  No Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID, or institutional profile pages could be found under this name.\n\n### Source:\n- A 2017 working paper includes Anastassiya Yegarmina as a co-author on regional foresight and innovation systems topics[1].\n\n---\n\n### 2. Research Contributions\n\n- **Key Publications:**  \n  The only identifiable publication linked to Anastassiya Yegarmina is:\n\n  - Kortov, S., Shulgin, D., Tolmachev, D., **Yegarmina, A.** (2017). *Regional Foresight for Bridging National Science, Technology and Innovation with Company Innovation: Experiences from Russia*, HSE Working papers WP BRP 29/STI/2014[1].\n\n- **Research Focus and Methodologies:**  \n  This paper discusses **technology foresight, innovation systems, and long-term forecasting** methodologies, likely involving data analysis and possibly computational modeling related to national innovation systems.\n\n- **Citation Metrics:**  \n  No citation metrics or impact data found for Yegarmina.\n\n- **Collaborative Networks:**  \n  Co-authors include Sergey Kortov, Dmitry Shulgin, and Dmitrii Tolmachev, affiliated with Russian academic or research institutions focused on science and technology policy[1].\n\n- **Recent Preprints/Working Papers:**  \n  No other preprints or recent papers found.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Professional Experience\n\n- **Employment History:**  \n  No LinkedIn profile or professional biographies available to detail work history.\n\n- **Industry Experience:**  \n  The mention of preparation for a PhD in computational neuroscience implies a transition from industry to academia, but no specifics or company affiliations were found.\n\n- **Professional Affiliations:**  \n  No memberships or society affiliations located.\n\n- **Leadership Roles:**  \n  None publicly identified.\n\n- **Patents or Applied Work:**  \n  No patents or technical reports attributed to Yegarmina found.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Active Inference & Related Research\n\n- **Direct Connections to Active Inference:**  \n  No publications or projects directly linking Anastassiya Yegarmina to active inference, free energy principle, Bayesian inference, or computational neuroscience were found.\n\n- **Adjacent Fields:**  \n  The 2017 work relates more to technology foresight than to neuroscience or active inference frameworks.\n\n- **Methodological Overlap:**  \n  No evident use of computational modeling or simulation frameworks directly connected to active inference.\n\n- **Potential Applications:**  \n  Given expertise in data science and innovation forecasting, there could be indirect applications in modeling complex systems, but no explicit evidence.\n\n- **Research Gaps:**  \n  In absence of published work, no identifiable gaps or contributions to active inference research.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Academic & Professional Network\n\n- **Key Collaborators:**  \n  Sergey Kortov, Dmitry Shulgin, Dmitrii Tolmachev based on the 2017 paper[1].\n\n- **Conference Presentations:**  \n  No records of presentations or talks at active inference or neuroscience conferences.\n\n- **Workshop Participation:**  \n  None found.\n\n- **Community Engagement:**  \n  No blogs, tutorials, or code repositories discovered.\n\n- **Social Media Related to Research:**  \n  No Twitter/X or other academic social media presence identified.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Online Presence & Resources\n\n- **Personal Website or Research Page:**  \n  None found.\n\n- **Google Scholar Profile:**  \n  None available.\n\n- **ResearchGate Profile:**  \n  None found.\n\n- **LinkedIn Profile:**  \n  No verified profile discovered.\n\n- **GitHub or Code Repositories:**  \n  No repositories linked to this name.\n\n- **Twitter/X or Other Social Media:**  \n  No research-related social media profiles identified.\n\n- **ORCID Profile:**  \n  No ORCID iD registered or publicly linked.\n\n- **Institutional Profile:**  \n  None identified.\n\n- **Videos, Podcasts, Interviews:**  \n  No media appearances found.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Future Potential & Opportunities\n\n- **Emerging Research Directions:**  \n  Without recent publications or public research statements, it is not possible to identify emerging directions.\n\n- **Opportunities for Growth in Active Inference:**  \n  A shift from industry data science to computational neuroscience PhD preparation suggests potential for future contributions, especially if integrating data science skills into active inference or computational modeling.\n\n- **Potential Impact:**  \n  Currently unestablished due to lack of visible research output in the active inference domain.\n\n- **Strategic Collaboration:**  \n  Collaborations with neuroscience or computational modeling groups could be promising if research focus shifts accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- The only verifiable trace of Anastassiya Yegarmina is as a co-author on a 2017 paper on **regional foresight and innovation systems** in Russia, with no direct publicly available research output or profiles in computational neuroscience, data science, or active inference domains[1].\n- No academic or professional profiles, publications, or social media presence related to active inference or computational neuroscience could be found.\n- This suggests either the researcher is early in academic career, transitioning from industry with limited public footprint, or using a different professional name online.\n- Further information may require direct inquiry through symposium organizers or personal contact.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n[1] Sergey Kortov, Dmitry Shulgin, Dmitrii Tolmachev, Anastassiya Yegarmina (2017). *Regional Foresight for Bridging National Science, Technology and Innovation with Company Innovation: Experiences from Russia.* HSE Working papers WP BRP 29/STI/2014.
