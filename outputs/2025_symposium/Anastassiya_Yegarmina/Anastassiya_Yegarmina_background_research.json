  "content": "## Academic Background\n\n**Degrees, Institutions, and Graduation Years**  \nNo direct evidence of Anastassiya Yegarmina's academic degrees, institutions, or graduation years was found in the available search results or via supplementary searches of major academic databases, institutional websites, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, LinkedIn, or ORCID. The user-provided information notes a preparation for a PhD in computational neuroscience, but no independent verification or details (such as MSc, BSc, or enrollment dates) are available in open sources.\n\n**Research Areas and Expertise**  \nAccording to the user-provided background, Anastassiya Yegarmina’s expertise spans data science and computational neuroscience, with a transition from industry to academia. However, no peer-reviewed publications, preprints, or conference proceedings directly attributed to her under this name were found in the search results or in supplementary searches of Google Scholar, ResearchGate, arXiv, or institutional repositories. Her name appears only once in the academic literature as a co-author on a working paper, but without further details about her role or contributions[1].\n\n**Current and Past Academic Positions**  \nNo evidence of current or past academic positions (e.g., postdoctoral researcher, lecturer, research assistant) at any institution was found. There are no institutional profile pages or faculty listings that mention her.\n\n**Notable Achievements, Awards, Grants, Honors**  \nNo announcements of awards, grants, honors, or notable achievements were found in the available sources.\n\n**Academic Profile Pages**  \nNo Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID, or institutional profile pages were found under the name Anastassiya Yegarmina. Searches on these platforms returned no results matching her name and research interests.\n\n## Research Contributions\n\n**Key Publications**  \nAnastassiya Yegarmina is listed as a co-author on the working paper:  \n**“Regional Foresight for Bridging National Science, Technology and Innovation with Company Innovation: Experiences from Russia”**, HSE Working Papers, WP BRP 29/STI/2014, National Research University Higher School of Economics, 2017, with Sergey Kortov, Dmitry Shulgin, Dmitrii Tolmachev, and Anastassiya Yegarmina[1].  \nHowever, no full text, abstract, or DOI for this paper is available in the search results or via open-access repositories. There are no other publications, preprints, or technical reports attributed to her in major databases.\n\n**Research Focus Areas and Methodologies**  \nGiven the single co-authorship on a foresight and innovation policy paper, her direct involvement in computational neuroscience or data science research cannot be confirmed from available sources. The working paper’s focus is on regional innovation systems and technology foresight, not computational neuroscience or data science[1].\n\n**Citation Metrics**  \nNo citation metrics (h-index, total citations) are available, as no Google Scholar or ResearchGate profile exists.\n\n**Collaborative Networks**  \nHer only identifiable co-authors are Sergey Kortov, Dmitry Shulgin, and Dmitrii Tolmachev, based on the 2017 working paper[1]. No evidence of ongoing collaborations, research groups, or joint projects in computational neuroscience or data science was found.\n\n**Recent Preprints and Working Papers**  \nNo recent preprints (e.g., on arXiv, bioRxiv) or working papers were found.\n\n## Professional Experience\n\n**Employment History**  \nNo verifiable employment history, industry roles, or consulting work was found in the available sources or on professional networks such as LinkedIn.\n\n**Professional Affiliations and Society Memberships**  \nNo memberships in professional societies (e.g., Society for Neuroscience, IEEE, INCF) were found.\n\n**Leadership Roles**  \nNo evidence of leadership roles in professional organizations.\n\n**Patents, Technical Reports, or Applied Work**  \nNo patents, technical reports, or applied industry work were found.\n\n## Active Inference & Related Research\n\n**Direct Connections to Active Inference**  \nNo publications, presentations, or projects directly related to Active Inference, the free energy principle, or Bayesian inference in neuroscience were found.\n\n**Adjacent Fields and Methodological Overlap**  \nNo evidence of work in computational neuroscience, Bayesian modeling, or related methodologies was found beyond the user-provided background.\n\n**Potential Applications and Research Gaps**  \nBased on the available information, there is no evidence that Anastassiya Yegarmina has published or presented work that directly applies to Active Inference. Any potential to address research gaps in this field is speculative and not supported by current public records.\n\n## Academic & Professional Network\n\n**Key Collaborators**  \nOnly the co-authors from the 2017 working paper are confirmed: Sergey Kortov, Dmitry Shulgin, and Dmitrii Tolmachev[1]. No other collaborators in computational neuroscience or data science were identified.\n\n**Conference Presentations**  \nNo records of conference presentations, workshop participation, or organization were found.\n\n**Community Engagement**  \nNo blog posts, tutorials, code repositories (GitHub), or other community engagement activities were found.\n\n**Social Media Presence**  \nNo Twitter/X, LinkedIn, or other social media profiles were found under this name that are clearly associated with computational neuroscience or data science research.\n\n## Online Presence & Resources\n\n**Personal Website or Research Page**  \nNone found.\n\n**Google Scholar Profile**  \nNone found.\n\n**ResearchGate Profile**  \nNone found.\n\n**LinkedIn Profile**  \nNone found under this name with relevant academic or industry background.\n\n**GitHub or Other Code Repositories**  \nNone found.\n\n**Twitter/X or Other Social Media**  \nNone found.\n\n**ORCID Profile**  \nNone found.\n\n**Institutional Profile Page**  \nNone found.\n\n**Videos, Podcasts, or Interviews**  \nNone found.\n\n## Future Potential & Opportunities\n\n**Emerging Research Directions**  \nNo recent publications or preprints suggest emerging research directions in computational neuroscience or Active Inference.\n\n**Opportunities for Growth in Active Inference Community**  \nThere is no public evidence of current engagement with the Active Inference community. Opportunities for future involvement would depend on establishing a visible research track record in relevant areas.\n\n**Potential Impact on the Field**  \nNo evidence of impact on computational neuroscience or Active Inference is available.\n\n**Strategic Collaboration Opportunities**  \nNo evidence of strategic collaborations or networks in the target research areas was found.\n\n## Summary of Findings\n\n- **Anastassiya Yegarmina** is listed as a co-author on a single working paper in innovation policy, but no further academic or professional details are publicly available[1].\n- **No evidence** of academic degrees, institutional affiliations, employment history, or professional memberships was found.\n- **No publications, preprints, or presentations** in computational neuroscience, data science, or Active Inference were found.\n- **No online profiles** (Google Scholar, ResearchGate, LinkedIn, ORCID, GitHub, Twitter/X) or institutional pages were identified.\n- **No community engagement** (blogs, tutorials, code) or conference activity was found.\n- **No evidence** of current or past involvement in Active Inference research or related fields beyond the user-provided background.\n\n**Limitations:** The absence of information does not necessarily indicate the absence of activity—only that no public, verifiable records were found. It is possible that Anastassiya Yegarmina is early in her academic career, uses a different name professionally, or has not yet established a public academic profile.\n\n## References\n\n[1] [https://ideas.repec.org/a/hig/fsight/v6y2012i1p12-25.html](https://ideas.repec.org/a/hig/fsight/v6y2012i1p12-25.html)  \n*Note: This is the only source where Anastassiya Yegarmina is mentioned as a co-author; no further details or links to the full text are provided.*",
