I notice that several key fields in Penny Johnston's profile are empty. To create a truly personalized and effective curriculum, I'll need some essential information about:

1. **Background:** 
- Academic/professional background
- Current role/field
- Prior experience with related concepts (e.g., Bayesian inference, computational neuroscience)
- Mathematical/technical proficiency

2. **Current Active Inference Application:**
- How they currently use or plan to use Active Inference
- Their domain of application
- Specific problems they're trying to solve

3. **Learning Needs:**
- Only "Resources" is mentioned - need more specifics about:
  * What types of resources?
  * Preferred learning formats?
  * Time availability?

4. **Challenges:**
- Specific obstacles they're facing
- Areas where they feel stuck
- Technical or conceptual difficulties

5. **Pragmatic/Epistemic Value Sought:**
- Practical outcomes they hope to achieve
- Theoretical understanding they wish to develop
- How they plan to apply the knowledge

Could you please provide these details so I can design a curriculum that:
- Matches their specific background and needs
- Addresses their actual challenges
- Delivers relevant practical and theoretical value
- Provides appropriate resources and learning paths
- Sets realistic timelines and milestones

This will allow me to create a truly personalized learning experience rather than a generic curriculum.
