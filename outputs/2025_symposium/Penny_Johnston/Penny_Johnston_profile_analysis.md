Based on the limited information provided in the profile outline for Penny Johnston, I can only provide a partial analysis focusing on her learning needs (the only field with any content, showing "Resources" as a need). Here's what I can reasonably infer and suggest:

1. **EXPERTISE ASSESSMENT**
- Appears to be at an early stage of Active Inference engagement given the focus on resource needs
- Full expertise level cannot be determined without additional background information

2. **LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES**
- Primary need identified: Access to resources
- Recommended starting points:
  * Introductory Active Inference literature and tutorials
  * Basic theoretical frameworks
  * Online learning platforms covering foundational concepts
  * Structured resource guides for beginners

3. **RESEARCH INTERESTS ALIGNMENT**
- Cannot determine specific alignments without background information
- General recommendation: Start with broad exposure to various Active Inference applications

4. **COLLABORATION POTENTIAL**
- Initial focus should be on connecting with other newcomers to the field
- Seek mentorship from experienced practitioners
- Join study groups or learning cohorts

5. **SYMPOSIUM PARTICIPATION STRATEGY**
- Focus on introductory sessions and tutorials
- Prioritize networking with others seeking resources
- Take advantage of Q&A sessions
- Document available resources shared during sessions

6. **DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP**
Short-term:
- Build foundational knowledge through available resources
- Identify specific areas of interest within Active Inference
Medium-term:
- Develop practical application skills
Long-term:
- To be determined based on emerging interests and background

7. **ACTIVE INFERENCE INTEGRATION**
- Cannot determine specific integration pathways without more background information
- Focus on understanding basic principles first

To provide a more detailed and accurate analysis, additional information would be needed about:
- Professional background
- Current role and expertise
- Specific interests in Active Inference
- Technical capabilities
- Research experience
- Domain expertise
- Current projects or applications

This would allow for more targeted recommendations and a more comprehensive development strategy.
