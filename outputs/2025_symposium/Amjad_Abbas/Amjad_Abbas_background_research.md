# Summary

The individual **Amjad Abbas** at **NHS Foundation Trust Somerset** appears to be a clinical or research staff member involved peripherally in NHS clinical research consortia (e.g., COVID-19 trials), but no publicly available academic or professional profile, research publications, or Active Inference-related activity could be identified. This may indicate an early-career clinician/researcher or a non-academic clinical role with limited public-facing research output.

If more specific institutional access or direct contact information were available, deeper internal records or unpublished research contributions might be accessible.
