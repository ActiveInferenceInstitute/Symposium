Focus on building foundational technical skills\n2. Seek technical collaborators early\n3. Start with simple models of moral decision-making\n4. Develop visual/intuitive understanding before mathematical depth\n5. Connect with researchers working on social applications\n6. Document theoretical framework for technical translation\n7. Build interdisciplinary bridges between technical and philosophical aspects\n\nThis profile suggests someone with strong theoretical potential who needs technical support to realize their vision. The focus should be on building basic technical literacy while leveraging their unique perspective on morality and law.",
