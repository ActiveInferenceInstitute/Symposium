- Research Background: Criminal Law & Neuroscience PhD student
- Domain Expertise: Legal/philosophical perspective on morality, neuroscientific foundations

2. **LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES**
- Primary Gaps: Mathematical foundations, computational modeling skills
- Recommended Path: 
  * Start with conceptual-to-mathematical bridges
  * Focus on visual/intuitive explanations of key principles
  * Gradual introduction to basic modeling tools
- Skills to Develop: Basic programming, mathematical notation, model thinking
- Resources: Interactive tutorials, visual learning tools, simplified modeling frameworks

3. **RESEARCH INTERESTS ALIGNMENT**
- Strong alignment: Moral decision-making and Active Inference
- Potential Directions:
  * Modeling moral decision-making processes
  * In-group/out-group dynamics through Active Inference lens
  * Legal reasoning as hierarchical inference
- Contribution Areas: Theoretical frameworks, ethical implications, legal applications

4. **COLLABORATION POTENTIAL**
- Complementary Partners Needed:
  * Mathematical modeling experts
  * Computational neuroscientists
  * Social psychology researchers
- Community Contributions:
  * Legal/ethical perspectives
  * Framework for moral reasoning
  * Bridge between law and Active Inference

5. **SYMPOSIUM PARTICIPATION STRATEGY**
Priority Focus:
- Attend introductory modeling workshops
- Connect with potential technical collaborators
- Participate in ethics/philosophy discussions
- Share legal/moral theory perspective

6. **DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP**
- Short-term: Gain basic modeling understanding
- Medium-term: Develop collaborative research project
- Long-term: Integration of Active Inference into legal/moral theory
- Metrics: Understanding of basic models, established collaborations, theory development

7. **ACTIVE INFERENCE INTEGRATION**
- Alignment: Strong theoretical fit with moral decision-making
- Contribution Opportunities:
  * Novel applications in legal reasoning
  * Ethical framework development
  * Social dynamics modeling
- Integration Strategy:
  * Build interdisciplinary bridges
  * Develop accessible explanations for legal community
  * Create practical applications for legal/moral reasoning

**Key Recommendations:**

1. Focus initially on understanding basic modeling concepts without getting overwhelmed by mathematical details

2. Seek partnerships with technical experts who can complement theoretical work

3. Develop clear use cases for Active Inference in legal/moral reasoning

4. Create accessible explanations for non-technical audiences

5. Build network of interdisciplinary collaborators

This profile suggests someone who can make valuable contributions to Active Inference theory's application in social/moral domains, particularly if supported with technical collaboration. The focus should be on leveraging their unique perspective while gradually building technical competency.
