  * Build basic programming literacy (e.g., Python basics)
  * Study simplified mathematical notation for core concepts
- Key Resources:
  * Introductory tutorials focused on intuitive understanding
  * Visual modeling tools
  * Case studies applying Active Inference to social sciences

3. **RESEARCH INTERESTS ALIGNMENT**
- Strong alignment in studying moral cognition through Active Inference
- Potential Directions:
  * Modeling moral decision-making processes
  * Understanding group dynamics and moral behavior
  * Developing computational models of normative reasoning
- Contribution Areas: Bridging legal/philosophical concepts with Active Inference

4. **COLLABORATION POTENTIAL**
- Ideal Collaborators:
  * Technical experts in Active Inference modeling
  * Computational neuroscientists
  * Social scientists working on moral behavior
