## 4. Active Inference & Related Research

- **Direct Connections to Active Inference:**  
  Jozef self-reports working on developing a theory of morality based on *active inference* principles, aiming to mathematically model morality within this framework. This is consistent with his interdisciplinary background bridging neuroscience (active inference is a brain theory) and criminal law[6](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/jozef-coppelmans).

- **Related Fields:**  
  His research touches on *neurolaw*, *free energy principle*, *Bayesian inference*, and *computational neuroscience* by applying empirical cognitive science to legal theory and morality[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02842-8).

- **Methodological Overlap:**  
  Uses *empirical studies* to investigate emotional influences on criminalization, hinting at potential future computational modeling and formalization within active inference frameworks.

- **Potential Applications:**  
  His work could bridge criminal law theory with computational neuroscience models, specifically by formalizing moral decision-making processes within active inference, which would be novel and impactful.

- **Research Gaps:**  
  Currently, much of criminal law theory remains conceptual; his approach integrating active inference mathematics and modeling represents a promising gap-filling direction.

## 7. Future Potential & Opportunities

- **Emerging Research Directions:**  
  Developing a *mathematical and computational theory of morality* grounded in active inference principles is a novel and promising interdisciplinary field combining law, neuroscience, and computational modeling[6](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/jozef-coppelmans).

- **Opportunities for Growth:**  
  Active inference is a rapidly growing framework in neuroscience and cognitive science. Applying it to *criminal law* and *moral philosophy* could open new avenues for legal theory, neurolaw, and AI ethics.

- **Potential Impact:**  
  Formalizing morality within active inference could influence legal standards, criminalization criteria, and moral decision-making models, bridging science and law.

- **Strategic Collaborations:**  
  Collaborations with computational neuroscientists, philosophers of law, and data scientists specializing in active inference modeling would enhance his research[3][6].
