I'll design a personalized curriculum for Jozef that bridges philosophical/legal theory with computational modeling, focusing on making Active Inference accessible for humanities scholars interested in moral cognition.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Strong conceptual understanding of Active Inference in moral theory
- Limited mathematical/computational background
- Academic background suggests strength in theoretical frameworks and philosophical reasoning
- Gap in practical modeling implementation
- Likely learns best through conceptual frameworks with gradual mathematical introduction

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Phase 1 (Months 1-2): Mathematical Foundations
- Basic probability theory through moral decision-making examples
- Introduction to Bayesian inference using ethical dilemmas
- Visual and intuitive explanations of key mathematical concepts

Phase 2 (Months 2-4): Active Inference Basics
- Free energy principle explained through moral behavior
- Belief updating in moral decision-making
- Simple modeling concepts using familiar scenarios

Phase 3 (Months 4-6): Applied Modeling
- Basic computational implementation
- Moral decision-making models
- Integration with legal/philosophical frameworks

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
Module 1: Mathematical Preliminaries
- Probability basics through moral choice examples
- Basic calculus concepts via behavioral modeling
- Statistical inference in moral decision-making

Module 2: Active Inference Fundamentals
- Free energy principle in moral behavior
- Belief updating and moral learning
- Action selection in ethical decisions

Module 3: Modeling Basics
- Introduction to Python/MATLAB using moral scenarios
- Simple model implementation
- Data visualization and interpretation

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
- Start with pre-built models of moral decision-making
- Modify existing code to explore different scenarios
- Graduate to building simple models from scratch
- Collaborative projects with technical partners

5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**
- Hierarchical models of moral behavior
- Integration of legal frameworks with Active Inference
- Cultural and social dimensions in moral modeling
- Advanced mathematical concepts as needed

6. **PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS**
Case Studies:
- Modeling moral development
- Legal decision-making processes
- Cultural transmission of moral values
- Ethical learning and adaptation

7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**
- Join Active Inference Institute
- Connect with computational neuroscience groups
- Attend workshops combining ethics and modeling
- Present at interdisciplinary conferences

8. **ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION**
Milestones:
- Basic mathematical literacy
- Simple model implementation
- Integration with theoretical framework
- Published collaborative work

9. **RESOURCES AND TOOLS**
Essential Reading:
- "Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior"
- Selected papers on moral cognition and Active Inference
- Basic programming tutorials in Python/MATLAB

Tools:
- SPM software
- Python with NumPy/SciPy
- Active Inference tutorials

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

Short-term (1-3 months):
- Master basic mathematical concepts
- Learn fundamental Active Inference principles
- Begin simple programming exercises

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Implement basic moral decision models
- Collaborate on technical aspects
- Integrate with theoretical framework

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Develop comprehensive moral theory with computational backing
- Publish initial results
- Present at conferences

Success Metrics:
- Ability to implement basic models
- Integration of computational and theoretical work
- Published collaborative papers
- Presentation at major conferences

This curriculum emphasizes:
1. Gradual introduction of technical concepts
2. Constant connection to moral/legal theory
3. Collaborative opportunities
4. Practical application focus
5. Building toward publication and presentation
