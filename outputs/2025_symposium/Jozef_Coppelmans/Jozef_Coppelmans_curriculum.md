I'll design a personalized curriculum for Jozef that bridges philosophical/legal theory with Active Inference modeling, focusing on accessible mathematical concepts.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Strong: Conceptual understanding of Active Inference, philosophical foundations
- Gaps: Mathematical formalization, computational modeling
- Learning style: Theoretical/conceptual learner with humanities background
- Need: Bridge between philosophical concepts and mathematical implementation

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Phase 1 (Months 1-2): Mathematical Foundations
- Basic probability theory through moral decision-making examples
- Introduction to Bayesian inference using ethical dilemmas
- Foundational concepts of free energy principle

Phase 2 (Months 2-4): Basic Modeling
- Simple computational models using accessible tools
- Visual/graphical representations of active inference
- Connecting mathematical concepts to moral theory

Phase 3 (Months 4-6): Applied Integration
- Implementing moral frameworks in active inference models
- Collaborative projects with technical partners
- Publishing and sharing findings

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
Module 1: Mathematical Basics
- Probability basics through moral choice scenarios
- Introduction to Bayesian networks
- Basic calculus concepts relevant to active inference

Module 2: Active Inference Fundamentals
- Free energy principle simplified
- Belief updating in moral contexts
- Action selection and policy evaluation

Module 3: Moral Theory Integration
- Mapping ethical principles to mathematical frameworks
- Modeling moral decision-making
- Representing values in active inference models

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
- Start with visual modeling tools (e.g., Lucidchart)
- Progress to simplified Python notebooks
- Group workshops with technical collaborators
- Small-scale models of moral decision scenarios

5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**
- Multi-agent moral systems
- Hierarchical active inference models
- Integration with legal frameworks
- Emerging research in moral AI

6. **PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS**
Case Studies:
- Modeling moral development
- Legal decision-making frameworks
- Ethical AI systems
- Criminal behavior prediction

7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**
- Join Active Inference Institute
- Attend workshops combining AI and ethics
- Connect with computational neuroscience groups
- Participate in philosophy of mind conferences

8. **ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION**
Milestones:
- Basic mathematical model implementation
- First collaborative project completion
- Conference presentation
- Paper draft combining theory and modeling

9. **RESOURCES AND TOOLS**
Essential Reading:
- "Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior"
- Selected papers from Karl Friston
- Ethics and AI papers relating to active inference

Tools:
- Python with simplified modeling libraries
- Visual modeling software
- Collaborative platforms for shared projects

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

Short-term (1-3 months):
- Master basic mathematical concepts
- Create first simple models
- Establish collaboration network

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Implement basic moral decision models
- Present at workshop/conference
- Begin collaborative project

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Complete integrated theory-model framework
- Submit paper for publication
- Establish research group/network

Success Metrics:
- Implementation of working models
- Publication acceptance
- Established collaborations
- Integration into dissertation

Recommended Next Steps:
1. Join Active Inference Institute
2. Begin basic mathematics tutorials
3. Identify potential technical collaborators
4. Start simple modeling exercises
5. Schedule regular progress reviews

This curriculum emphasizes accessibility while ensuring rigorous development of necessary technical skills, always maintaining focus on the moral/legal theory application of Active Inference.
