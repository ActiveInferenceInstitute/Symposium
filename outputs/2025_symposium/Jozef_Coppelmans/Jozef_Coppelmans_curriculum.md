I'll design a personalized curriculum for Jozef that bridges his background in law/philosophy with Active Inference modeling, focusing on making the mathematical concepts accessible while maintaining rigor.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Strong conceptual understanding of Active Inference in moral cognition
- Limited mathematical/computational background
- Academic research orientation
- Needs: Translation between philosophical concepts and mathematical models
- Learning style: Likely conceptual-first, with gradual mathematical integration

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Months 1-2: Foundational Concepts
- Active Inference basics through philosophical/conceptual lens
- Gradual introduction to mathematical notation
- Basic probability concepts through moral decision-making examples

Months 3-4: Basic Modeling
- Simple computational models using moral dilemmas
- Introduction to free energy principle through intuitive examples
- Basic Python programming for model implementation

Months 5-6: Advanced Integration
- Connecting moral theory with Active Inference mathematics
- Collaborative project development
- Research paper preparation

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
Module 1: Conceptual Foundations
- Free Energy Principle in moral decision-making
- Belief updating in moral contexts
- Precision and uncertainty in moral judgments

Module 2: Mathematical Basics
- Probability theory through moral examples
- Bayesian inference in ethical reasoning
- Basic calculus concepts needed for Active Inference

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
- Using Jupyter notebooks with pre-written code
- Moral decision-making simulations
- Modified tutorials from Active Inference Lab
- Collaborative coding sessions with mentors

5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**
- Hierarchical moral inference
- Social Active Inference models
- Group moral behavior modeling
- Integration with legal theory

6. **PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS**
- Building simple models of moral decision-making
- Case studies from legal/ethical dilemmas
- Implementation in legal reasoning
- Validation against empirical moral psychology data

7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**
- Join Active Inference Institute
- Connect with computational ethicists
- Participate in Active Inference Journal Club
- Present at interdisciplinary workshops

8. **ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION**
Milestones:
- Basic model implementation
- First collaborative paper draft
- Conference presentation preparation
- Research network development

9. **RESOURCES AND TOOLS**
Readings:
- "Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior"
- Selected papers on moral cognition and Active Inference
- Simplified mathematical tutorials

Tools:
- Python (basic)
- Active Inference tutorials
- Google Colab for accessible computing

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

Short-term (1-3 months):
- Master conceptual foundations
- Basic mathematical literacy
- Initial model sketches

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Simple model implementation
- First collaborative paper draft
- Present at workshop/conference

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Complete working model
- Published paper
- Established research network

Success Metrics:
- Working computational model of moral inference
- Published collaborative paper
- Established research partnerships
- Conference presentation

This curriculum emphasizes:
- Conceptual understanding before mathematical formalism
- Practical applications in moral/legal contexts
- Building collaborative relationships
- Gradual skill development
- Regular feedback and adjustment

I recommend starting with conceptual mastery and gradually introducing mathematical concepts through relevant examples from moral philosophy and legal theory. This approach will make the technical aspects more accessible while maintaining focus on the practical applications in Jozef's field.
