Active Inference & Related Research\n\n- **Direct Connections:**  \n  - His self-reported background explicitly states development of a **theory of morality based on active inference**, indicating a direct and novel application of active inference principles to moral theory within criminal law and neuroscience.  \n- **Adjacent Fields:**  \n  - Active inference is closely related to the **free energy principle**, **Bayesian inference**, and **computational neuroscience**—all of which are relevant to his interdisciplinary work.  \n- **Methodological Overlap:**  \n  - His research involves the **mathematical modeling and simulation** of moral processes using active inference frameworks, suggesting expertise in computational modeling.  \n- **Potential Applications:**  \n  - This interdisciplinary approach could contribute to understanding moral cognition, legal responsibility, and decision-making processes in criminal justice, which are ripe areas for active inference application.  \n- **Research Gaps:**  \n  - The integration of active inference into legal and moral theory is relatively novel, suggesting he is positioned to address substantial theoretical and computational gaps in this emerging domain.\n\n---\n\n# 5. Academic & Professional Network\n\n- **Key Collaborators:** No publicly available data on collaborators or co-authors.  \n- **Conference Presentations:**  \n  - Participation in the **Active Inference Symposium** confirms engagement with the active inference research community.  \n- **Workshops/Community Involvement:** No public records of workshop organization or community tutorials authored by him.  \n- **Online Engagement:** No identified blogs, code repositories, or tutorials linked to his name.  \n- **Social Media:** No publicly found research-related social media profiles.\n\n---\n\n# 6.
