However, his interdisciplinary research clearly combines *criminal law* and *neuroscience*.\n\n- **Research Areas:** His work centers on the intersection of *criminal law*, *morality*, *neuroscience*, and *active inference*, with a focus on developing a theory of morality based on active inference principles[6](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/jozef-coppelmans).\n\n- **PhD Project:** His doctoral research is part of a broader project on \"Criminal law - criteria for criminalisation,\" emphasizing an interdisciplinary approach including neurolaw perspectives[1](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/research/research-projects/law/criminal-legislation---criteria-for-criminalisation).\n\n- **Academic Positions:** Currently a PhD student at Leiden University. No previous academic positions were found publicly.\n\n- **Notable Achievements:** No specific awards or grants publicly listed, but his participation in interdisciplinary research programs and publication in high-impact journals (Nature Humanities and Social Sciences Communications) indicate recognition in his field.\n\n- **Profiles:**\n  - [Leiden University Staff Page](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/jozef-coppelmans)[6]\n  - [ORCID: 0000-0001-8406-9125](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8406-9125)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Research Contributions\n\n- **Key Publications:**\n  - *An empirical investigation of emotion and the criminal law: towards a “criminalization bias”?*  \n    Published in *Humanities and Social Sciences Communications* (Nature), 2024  \n    DOI: 10.1057/s41599-024-02842-8  \n    This interdisciplinary study explores the role of emotion, especially disgust, in criminalization decisions by both laypeople and legal professionals[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02842-8).\n\n  - Correction notice for the above paper in 2025[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-05592-3).\n\n  - A related empirical study listed in Korean science database also credits Coppelmans for work in law and neuroscience[2](https://scienceon.kisti.re.kr/srch/selectPORSrchArticle.do?cn=NART129703896).\n\n- **Research Focus & Methodology:**  \n  His research uses *empirical cognitive science methods*, combining philosophy of law with neuroscience, particularly investigating emotional processes in moral and criminal decision-making[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02842-8).\n\n- **Citation Metrics:**  \n  Public citation metrics (h-index, total citations) are not available from the sources searched, likely due to his early career researcher status.\n\n- **Collaborations:**  \n  Frequent co-author includes Fieke M. A. Wagemans, suggesting interdisciplinary collaboration within law and neuroscience[2](https://scienceon.kisti.re.kr/srch/selectPORSrchArticle.do?cn=NART129703896).\n\n- **Preprints/Working Papers:**  \n  No public preprints or working papers found on arXiv, bioRxiv, or similar platforms.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Professional Experience\n\n- **Employment History:**  \n  Solely listed as a PhD candidate at Leiden University in Criminal Law and Neuroscience. No other employment or consulting roles found[6](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/jozef-coppelmans).\n\n- **Professional Affiliations:**  \n  Affiliated with Leiden University’s Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology and the Leiden Institute of Brain and Cognition, both interdisciplinary research hubs[6](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/jozef-coppelmans).\n\n- **Leadership Roles:**  \n  No evidence of leadership positions in professional organizations found.\n\n- **Patents/Technical Reports:**  \n  None found.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Active Inference & Related Research\n\n- **Direct Connections to Active Inference:**  \n  Jozef self-reports working on developing a theory of morality based on *active inference* principles, aiming to mathematically model morality within this framework. This is consistent with his interdisciplinary background bridging neuroscience (active inference is a brain theory) and criminal law[6](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/jozef-coppelmans).\n\n- **Related Fields:**  \n  His research touches on *neurolaw*, *free energy principle*, *Bayesian inference*, and *computational neuroscience* by applying empirical cognitive science to legal theory and morality[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02842-8).\n\n- **Methodological Overlap:**  \n  Uses *empirical studies* to investigate emotional influences on criminalization, hinting at potential future computational modeling and formalization within active inference frameworks.\n\n- **Potential Applications:**  \n  His work could bridge criminal law theory with computational neuroscience models, specifically by formalizing moral decision-making processes within active inference, which would be novel and impactful.\n\n- **Research Gaps:**  \n  Currently, much of criminal law theory remains conceptual; his approach integrating active inference mathematics and modeling represents a promising gap-filling direction.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Academic & Professional Network\n\n- **Key Collaborators:**  \n  - Fieke M. A. Wagemans (co-author on key publication)[2](https://scienceon.kisti.re.kr/srch/selectPORSrchArticle.do?cn=NART129703896)\n  - Affiliated research groups at Leiden University’s Law and Brain institutes[6](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/jozef-coppelmans).\n\n- **Conference Presentations:**  \n  No direct records of conference talks or symposium presentations found publicly.\n\n- **Workshops/Community Engagement:**  \n  No public evidence of workshop organization or blog posts.\n\n- **Social Media:**  \n  No verified Twitter, LinkedIn, or GitHub profiles found under the name \"Jozef Coppelmans.\"\n\n---\n\n## 6.

Future Potential & Opportunities\n\n- **Emerging Research Directions:**  \n  Developing a *mathematical and computational theory of morality* grounded in active inference principles is a novel and promising interdisciplinary field combining law, neuroscience, and computational modeling[6](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/jozef-coppelmans).\n\n- **Opportunities for Growth:**  \n  Active inference is a rapidly growing framework in neuroscience and cognitive science. Applying it to *criminal law* and *moral philosophy* could open new avenues for legal theory, neurolaw, and AI ethics.\n\n- **Potential Impact:**  \n  Formalizing morality within active inference could influence legal standards, criminalization criteria, and moral decision-making models, bridging science and law.\n\n- **Strategic Collaborations:**  \n  Collaborations with computational neuroscientists, philosophers of law, and data scientists specializing in active inference modeling would enhance his research[3][6].\n\n---\n\n# References\n\n1.
