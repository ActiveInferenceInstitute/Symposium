I notice that several key pieces of information about John Graves are missing from the provided profile. To create a truly personalized curriculum, I'll need to know more about:

1. His background (technical expertise, domain knowledge, mathematical foundation)
2. His current Active Inference application interests/needs
3. Specific challenges he's facing
4. Pragmatic and epistemic goals

However, I can design an initial curriculum focused on his stated need for working Python examples with open-source implementation. Here's a draft that can be refined once more information is available:

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Initial focus on Python implementation capabilities
- Evaluation of mathematical/statistical background needed for Active Inference
- Assessment of familiarity with key probabilistic concepts

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Starting with practical implementation:
- Week 1-2: Python fundamentals for Active Inference
- Week 3-4: Basic probabilistic modeling in Python
- Week 5-8: Active Inference implementation frameworks
- Week 9-12: Applied projects and optimization

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
Focused on implementation:
- Probability theory in Python
- Free energy principle basics with code examples
- Generative models implementation
- Policy selection algorithms

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
Emphasizing open-source tools:
- PyAI framework tutorials
- Jupyter notebook exercises
- Small-scale implementation projects
- Code review and optimization practices

5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**
Implementation-focused:
- Advanced Python optimization for Active Inference
- Scaling Active Inference models
- Custom implementation strategies
- Performance optimization

6. **PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS**
Code-first approach:
- Building reusable Active Inference components
- Testing and validation frameworks
- Documentation best practices
- Deployment strategies

7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**
Open-source focus:
- GitHub collaboration
- Code sharing practices
- Documentation contribution
- Open-source project participation

8. **ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION**
Code-based evaluation:
- Implementation portfolio development
- Code quality metrics
- Performance benchmarking
- Contribution to open-source projects

9. **RESOURCES AND TOOLS**
Recommended resources:
- PyAI documentation
- Active Inference notebooks repository
- Python optimization resources
- Community code examples

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**
Short-term (1-3 months):
- Basic Active Inference implementation
- Working with existing frameworks
- Simple model deployment

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Custom implementation development
- Advanced optimization
- Contributing to open-source projects

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Framework development
- Advanced applications
- Community leadership

To make this curriculum more specific and effective, please provide:
1. John's technical background
2. His specific Active Inference interests
3. Current challenges
4. Desired practical outcomes

This will allow me to tailor the content, pacing, and focus areas more precisely to his needs.
