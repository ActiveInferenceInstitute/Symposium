I notice that several key pieces of information about John Graves are missing from the provided background. To create a truly personalized curriculum, I'll first make some assumptions and then note how the curriculum would adapt based on different possible backgrounds.

Base Assumptions:
- Given the focus on Python examples, I'll assume John has some programming background
- The request for working examples suggests a practical implementation focus
- Looking for open-source solutions indicates interest in community engagement

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
Initial Focus Areas:
- Python programming proficiency assessment
- Understanding of basic probabilistic modeling
- Familiarity with machine learning concepts
- Experience with scientific computing libraries

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Recommended Track:
```python
Phase 1: Foundations (4-6 weeks)
- Basic Active Inference concepts
- Python fundamentals for Active Inference
- Working with key libraries (PyTorch, NumPy)

Phase 2: Implementation (6-8 weeks)
- Building simple Active Inference models
- Working with existing codebases
- Debugging and optimization

Phase 3: Advanced Applications (8-12 weeks)
- Custom model development
- Integration with other frameworks
- Performance optimization
```

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
Python-Centric Approach:
```python
# Example Module Structure
class ActiveInferenceFundamentals:
    def free_energy_principle():
        # Code examples and exercises
    
    def variational_inference():
        # Practical implementations
```

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
Recommended Projects:
1. Simple agent navigation using Active Inference
2. Perception-action loops in Python
3. Building a basic Active Inference framework

5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**
Focus on Implementation:
- Performance optimization techniques
- Scaling Active Inference models
- Integration with existing ML frameworks

6. **PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS**
GitHub-Ready Examples:
```python
# Repository Structure
active_inference_examples/
    └── basic_models/
    └── advanced_applications/
    └── integration_examples/
    └── optimization_tools/
```

7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**
Open-Source Focus:
- Contributing to existing Active Inference libraries
- Participating in code reviews
- Sharing implementations on GitHub
- Joining relevant Discord/Slack communities

8. **ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION**
Milestone Projects:
1. Basic agent implementation
2. Custom environment integration
3. Complex decision-making system
4. Performance optimization project

9. **RESOURCES AND TOOLS**
Essential Tools:
- Git/GitHub
- Python development environment
- Key libraries (PyTorch, NumPy, etc.)
- Documentation tools

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**
```python
# Timeline
Month 1-2: Basic Implementation
    - Set up development environment
    - Complete foundational tutorials
    - Build first simple model

Month 3-4: Advanced Development
    - Create custom implementations
    - Integrate with existing frameworks
    - Optimize performance

Month 5-6: Mastery
    - Contribute to open-source projects
    - Create novel applications
    - Share knowledge with community
```

Note: This curriculum can be adjusted based on:
- Prior programming experience level
- Specific application domain
- Time availability
- Learning style preferences

Would you be able to provide more details about John's background and specific needs so I can further customize this curriculum?
