I notice that several key pieces of information about John Graves are missing, which would help create a more targeted curriculum. However, I'll design a curriculum focused on his stated need for working Python examples and open-source implementation, while making some reasonable assumptions that we can adjust based on additional information.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Initial focus on Python implementation capabilities
- Assumption of basic familiarity with probability theory and Bayesian inference
- Need for practical, implementable examples identified

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
- Start with foundational Active Inference concepts through Python implementations
- Progress from simple to complex examples
- Focus on open-source tools and libraries
- 6-month learning trajectory with monthly milestones

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
Module 1: Foundations
- Free Energy Principle basics with Python examples
- Generative models in PyTorch
- Variational inference implementation

Module 2: Active Inference Basics
- Belief updating in code
- Action selection algorithms
- Simple agent implementations

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
Project Track:
1. Simple Grid World Agent
   - Basic environment setup
   - Policy learning
   - Action selection
2. Multi-armed Bandit Implementation
3. Complex Environment Agent
   - Custom environment creation
   - Advanced policy learning

5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**
- Deep Active Inference implementations
- Multi-agent systems
- Hierarchical models
- Custom environment design

6. **PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS**
- Integration with existing Python ML frameworks
- Performance optimization
- Scaling implementations
- Debug common issues

7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**
- GitHub repository setup
- Contributing to existing Active Inference libraries
- Joining Active Inference Discord/Slack communities
- Participation in code reviews

8. **ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION**
Milestones:
- Basic agent implementation
- Custom environment creation
- Complex policy learning
- Full system integration

9. **RESOURCES AND TOOLS**
Software:
- PyTorch
- gym/gymnasium
- Active Inference libraries (pymdp, inferactively)
GitHub Repositories:
- Example implementations
- Community projects
- Documentation resources

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

Short-term (1-3 months):
- Basic Active Inference concepts
- Simple agent implementation
- First working example

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Complex environments
- Custom implementations
- Integration with existing systems

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Advanced applications
- Contributing to open-source projects
- Creating novel implementations

Would you be able to provide more information about John's background, current Active Inference application, challenges, and the specific pragmatic and epistemic value he's seeking? This would help me refine the curriculum to better match his needs.
