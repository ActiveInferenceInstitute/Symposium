After exhaustive multi-source investigation, there appears to be **no publicly available detailed academic or professional profile for a researcher named "Quynh, Phan" specifically linked to the Active Inference Symposium or related active inference research** as of November 2025. The search covered major academic databases, conference records, professional and social media platforms, and preprint repositories without locating a matching profile. Below is a detailed account of the research process and findings:

---

### 1. Academic Background

- **No publicly accessible records** of educational history, degrees, or institutions associated with a "Phan Quynh" in the context of active inference or neuroscience/computational modeling were found.
- No ORCID, institutional profile, or Google Scholar page for this exact name linked to active inference or related computational neuroscience fields has been identified.
- The name "Phan" or "Quynh" appears in some Asian research contexts (Vietnamese and neighboring regions), but no combination precisely matching "Phan, Quynh" with relevant publications or profiles was retrievable.

### 2. Research Contributions

- No **key publications, journal articles, or conference papers** authored by "Phan, Quynh" in active inference, Bayesian inference, computational neuroscience, or machine learning databases.
- No citation metrics or h-index data available.
- The closest names found in AI or machine learning (e.g., Phan Nguyen, or Nguyen Quang) do not correspond to "Phan, Quynh" and are unrelated to active inference.
- No preprints or working papers in arXiv, bioRxiv, or similar repositories under this name in relevant fields.

### 3. Professional Experience

- No LinkedIn or institutional employment records for "Phan, Quynh" tied to research or industry roles in active inference or cognitive modeling.
- No documented consulting work or patents linked to this name.
- No evidence of professional society memberships or leadership roles.

### 4. Active Inference & Related Research

- No direct or indirect linkage between "Phan, Quynh" and **active inference, free energy principle, Bayesian frameworks, or computational neuroscience** in conference programs, symposium participant lists, or publication records.
- The Active Inference Symposium participant lists publicly available (including IJCNN 2025 and other neural network conferences) do not show this name.
- No presentations, projects, or methodological papers on active inference by this researcher found.

### 5. Academic & Professional Network

- No information on collaborators, co-authors, or joint publications involving "Phan, Quynh."
- No conference presentations or workshop participations documented.
- No public code repositories, blog posts, or tutorial contributions related to active inference or computational neuroscience.

### 6. Online Presence & Resources

- No personal website, professional profile, or online research page identifiable.
- No Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID, LinkedIn, GitHub, or Twitter/X accounts attributable to this individual and research area.
- No videos, podcasts, or interviews located.

### 7. Future Potential & Opportunities

- Without identifiable academic or professional footprint, no clear emerging research directions or potential impact in active inference can be assessed.
- No strategic collaboration opportunities or research gaps attributed to this individual.

---

### Summary

- **"Quynh, Phan" lacks a publicly traceable academic or research profile linked to Active Inference or related fields.**
- This might indicate:
  - The individual is an early-career researcher or student without a significant online footprint.
  - The name may be recorded differently in publications or databases (e.g., given name and surname reversed).
  - Participation in the Active Inference Symposium could be recent or informal, without public documentation yet.
  - The individual might be active under a different name or in fields not indexed by mainstream databases.
