## Metadata

- **participant**: Franklin
- **report_type**: background_research

---

After exhaustive web and academic database research, I found **no conclusive or direct matches** for an Active Inference Symposium participant named simply "Franklin" affiliated with Boston Children's Hospital, with explicit links to active inference research. However, several relevant individuals named Franklin connected to Boston Children’s Hospital and related biomedical research appear. Below is a detailed synthesis of findings based on the available data and likely candidates, with extensive citations and notes on limitations.

## 1. Academic Background

**Potential Candidate: Kathleen (Kate) Franklin, PhD, CCC-SLP**  
- Affiliated with Boston Children’s Health Physicians as Chief of Service for the Division of Speech and Language Pathology.  
- Also Department Chair and Associate Professor of Clinical Speech-Language Pathology at New York Medical College.  
- Completed doctoral work focused on augmentative/alternative communication (AAC) for complex communication disorders.  
- Over 25 years of academic and clinical experience teaching graduate coursework in child language development, diagnostics, AAC, and ethics.  
- No ORCID ID or explicit link to active inference found.  
- Boston Children’s Hospital affiliation is solid; however, her research is specialized in speech-language pathology rather than computational neuroscience or active inference.  
- Source: Boston Children’s Health Physicians profile [1](https://bchp.childrenshospital.org/providers/kathleen-franklin).

**No other "Franklin" with clear academic background at Boston Children’s Hospital found in active inference or computational neuroscience domains.**

---

## 2. Research Contributions

- **Kate Franklin’s research** centers on speech-language pathology and AAC; no publications or preprints related to active inference or computational neuroscience were found in major databases (Google Scholar, PubMed).  
- No direct publications linking this Franklin to active inference, free energy principle, or Bayesian modeling.  
- Another "Franklin" appears in a large clinical database study on emulating randomized clinical trials, affiliated with Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School (Boston area), but no clear link to Boston Children’s Hospital or active inference [3](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2804067).

---

## 3. Professional Experience

- Kate Franklin holds leadership and clinical education roles in speech-language pathology at Boston Children’s Health Physicians and New York Medical College [1](https://bchp.childrenshospital.org/providers/kathleen-franklin).  
- No additional evidence of industry consulting, patents, or leadership in computational neuroscience or active inference communities.  
- No LinkedIn or ResearchGate profiles clearly connected to active inference or computational neuroscience found for this Franklin.

---

## 4. Active Inference & Related Research

- No direct publications, presentations, or projects by Franklin at Boston Children’s Hospital involving active inference or the free energy principle.  
- Leading active inference researchers typically affiliated with other institutions (e.g., Karl Friston at UCL, Lisa Feldman Barrett at Northeastern, Mass General) [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5062100/), [5](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rstb.2016.0011).  
- Boston Children’s Hospital faculty involved in cardiovascular and pediatric cardiology research (e.g., William Pu) but not linked to active inference directly [2](https://www.navbo.org/training-programs/).

---

## 5. Academic & Professional Network

- No data on co-authorship or collaboration networks linking Franklin from Boston Children’s Hospital to active inference researchers.  
- No evidence of conference presentations, workshops, or community engagement related to active inference.

---

## 6. Online Presence & Resources

- Kathleen Franklin’s institutional profile: [Boston Children’s Health Physicians](https://bchp.childrenshospital.org/providers/kathleen-franklin) [1].  
- No Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID, or LinkedIn profiles clearly connect to active inference or Boston Children’s Hospital under this name.  
- No GitHub or social media accounts linked to active inference found.

---

## 7. Future Potential & Opportunities

- Without evidence of current active inference research by Franklin at Boston Children’s Hospital, it is not possible to assess emerging research directions or strategic collaborations in this domain.  
- If Franklin’s work in speech-language pathology intersects with computational modeling or neurocognitive theories in future, potential applications to active inference could arise, but this remains speculative.

# Important Notes and Limitations

- The search was based on the name "Franklin" affiliated with Boston Children’s Hospital and active inference symposium participation. No definitive profile matching all criteria was found.  
- Kathleen Franklin is a confirmed Boston Children’s Hospital faculty member but specializes in speech-language pathology, not active inference.  
- Other Franklins in the Boston medical research community have different foci (e.g., clinical epidemiology, cardiology).  
- Active inference is a specialized field largely dominated by researchers at other institutions.  
- If this Franklin is an early-career researcher or uses a different first name, more identifying details would be necessary for deeper search.  
- No ORCID or direct digital footprints for active inference-related work found for Franklin at Boston Children’s Hospital.

If you can provide additional identifiers (first name, ORCID, or specific publications), I can carry out an even deeper targeted investigation.
