I notice that several key pieces of information about Haris Neophytou are missing from the provided background. To create a truly personalized and effective curriculum, I'll need to know:

1. Their current background (academic/professional experience)
2. How they're currently applying or planning to apply Active Inference
3. Specific learning needs and goals
4. Current challenges they're facing
5. What practical and theoretical knowledge they're seeking

Could you provide these details about Haris? This would help me design a curriculum that:
- Builds on their existing knowledge
- Addresses their specific challenges
- Aligns with their professional goals
- Matches their learning style
- Focuses on relevant applications

Once you share these details, I can create a comprehensive, customized curriculum following the structure you've outlined, with specific:
- Learning paths
- Timeframes
- Resources
- Projects
- Assessment methods

Would you please provide the missing information about Haris's background and goals?
