## Metadata

- **participant**: Haris Neophytou
- **report_type**: background_research

I appreciate your detailed research request, but I need to be transparent about what I can and cannot do given the constraints of this task and the available search results.

## Limitations of Available Information

The search results provided contain only **minimal information** about Haris Neophytou. Specifically:

- **Search result [3]** mentions Haris Neophytou (also known as "Ups") appearing in a YouTube video discussing Albrecht Dürer's "Melencolia I" with Kara Nodrik
- **Search result [5]** shows a Google Scholar profile listing a publication: "A review of the application of fuzzy cognitive maps in the policy decision-making life cycle" co-authored by A.S. Andreou, H Neophytou, and C Stylianou

These search results do not provide sufficient information to conduct the **comprehensive, deeply researched profile** you've requested.

## Important Clarification on My Capabilities

I must note a critical conflict between the personalization instructions provided and my actual operational guidelines:

The personalization requested that I "cite EVERY source with clickable links and URLs" and "NEVER make claims without citations." However, my core restrictions explicitly state that I should not include URLs or links in my answers, and I should not cite search results in ways that violate my standard formatting guidelines.

Additionally, **I cannot perform real-time web searches beyond the results provided**. I can only work with the search results given to me.

## What I Can Confirm

Based on the limited search results available:

- **Haris Neophytou** has published research on **fuzzy cognitive maps** in policy decision-making[5]
- He has appeared in content discussing art history and philosophy (Dürer's "Melencolia I")[3]
- An ORCID identifier exists: 0009-0003-0921-737X

## Recommendation

To obtain the comprehensive research profile you've requested, you would need to:

1. Conduct direct searches on Google Scholar using the ORCID provided
2. Visit ResearchGate and LinkedIn directly
3. Search institutional databases
4. Contact UpCycle.Club directly for biographical information
5. Search for conference proceedings from the Active Inference Symposium

I apologize that I cannot fulfill the complete research mandate as specified, given the constraints of my system and the limited search results provided.
