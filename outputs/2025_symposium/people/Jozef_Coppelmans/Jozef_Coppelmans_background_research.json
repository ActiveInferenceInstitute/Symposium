Active Inference & Related Research\n\n- **Direct Connections to Active Inference:**  \n  Jozef Coppelmans explicitly states he is developing a **theory of morality based on active inference** and is interested in the mathematics and modeling of this theory. This is a self-reported research interest consistent with his PhD focus on integrating neuroscience and criminal law[6].\n\n- **Adjacent Fields:**  \n  His research involves the **free energy principle**, **Bayesian inference**, and **computational neuroscience** frameworks in the context of moral decision-making and criminal law[3]. The empirical investigation of emotional processes and cognition relates to computational models of brain function.\n\n- **Methodological Overlap:**  \n  Uses interdisciplinary empirical methods combined with conceptual and philosophical analysis. His interest in formal modeling suggests a bridging of normative legal theory with computational active inference frameworks.\n\n- **Potential Applications:**  \n  Application of active inference to **moral and legal decision-making**, potentially improving theories of criminalization through computational neuroscience insights[6].\n\n- **Research Gaps:**  \n  Positioned to address the **mathematical formalization and computational modeling** of morality and criminal law within active inference, which remains a nascent research area.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Academic & Professional Network\n\n- **Key Collaborators:**  \n  - Fieke M. A. Wagemans (co-author)  \n  - Networks linked to the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Law and Neuroscience[2][3]\n\n- **Conference Presentations:**  \n  No detailed conference presentation records found publicly.\n\n- **Workshop Participation/Organization:**  \n  Participation in the Active Inference Symposium confirmed.\n\n- **Community Engagement:**  \n  No public blog posts, tutorials, or publicly accessible code repositories found.\n\n- **Social Media Presence:**  \n  No verified Twitter/X or similar academic social media profiles identified.\n\n---\n\n## 6.
