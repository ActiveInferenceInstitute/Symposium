## 4. Active Inference & Related Research

- **Direct Connections to Active Inference:**  
  Jozef Coppelmans explicitly states he is developing a **theory of morality based on active inference** and is interested in the mathematics and modeling of this theory. This is a self-reported research interest consistent with his PhD focus on integrating neuroscience and criminal law[6].

- **Adjacent Fields:**  
  His research involves the **free energy principle**, **Bayesian inference**, and **computational neuroscience** frameworks in the context of moral decision-making and criminal law[3]. The empirical investigation of emotional processes and cognition relates to computational models of brain function.

- **Methodological Overlap:**  
  Uses interdisciplinary empirical methods combined with conceptual and philosophical analysis. His interest in formal modeling suggests a bridging of normative legal theory with computational active inference frameworks.

- **Potential Applications:**  
  Application of active inference to **moral and legal decision-making**, potentially improving theories of criminalization through computational neuroscience insights[6].

- **Research Gaps:**  
  Positioned to address the **mathematical formalization and computational modeling** of morality and criminal law within active inference, which remains a nascent research area.
