Here's a comprehensive analysis of Jozef Coppelmans' profile:

1. **EXPERTISE ASSESSMENT**
- Knowledge Level: Conceptual understanding of Active Inference, limited technical/mathematical background
- Technical Skills: Primarily theoretical/philosophical approach
- Research Background: Criminal Law & Neuroscience PhD student
- Domain Expertise: Strong in legal/moral philosophy and criminal law
- Notable: Has developed conceptual framework connecting morality and Active Inference

2. **LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES**
- Primary Gap: Mathematical and computational modeling skills
- Recommended Path:
  * Start with visual/intuitive explanations of Active Inference
  * Focus on qualitative understanding before quantitative
  * Begin with simple modeling examples
  * Connect mathematical concepts to familiar philosophical frameworks
- Skills to Develop:
  * Basic programming
  * Mathematical notation and concepts
  * Model design and implementation
  * Data analysis fundamentals

3. **RESEARCH INTERESTS ALIGNMENT**
- Strong alignment in theoretical applications
- Potential Directions:
  * Modeling moral decision-making
  * Group dynamics and moral behavior
  * Legal reasoning through Active Inference lens
  * Social dynamics and in-group/out-group behavior
- Current Gap: Translation between theoretical framework and computational models

4. **COLLABORATION POTENTIAL**
- Ideal Collaborators:
  * Mathematical modelers
  * Computational neuroscientists
  * Social psychology researchers
  * Ethics/philosophy scholars
- Can Contribute:
  * Theoretical framework development
  * Legal/ethical implications
  * Real-world application contexts
  * Interdisciplinary perspective

5. **SYMPOSIUM PARTICIPATION STRATEGY**

6. **DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP**
- Short-term:
  * Gain basic modeling understanding
  * Identify potential collaborators
  * Clarify technical requirements
- Medium-term:
  * Develop simple computational models
  * Begin collaborative projects
  * Integrate feedback into theoretical framework
- Long-term:
  * Complete dissertation with computational component
  * Establish new framework for moral reasoning
  * Bridge law/philosophy and Active Inference

7. **ACTIVE INFERENCE INTEGRATION**
- Current Integration:
  * Theoretical framework for moral cognition
  * Application to group dynamics
  * Legal decision-making processes
- Opportunities:
  * Model development for moral decision-making
  * Testing theoretical predictions
  * Applications in legal reasoning
  * Social policy implications

**Recommendations:**
1. Focus initially on understanding basic modeling concepts without getting overwhelmed by mathematical details
2. Seek partnerships with technical collaborators who can implement models
3. Document real-world cases that could benefit from Active Inference analysis
4. Develop clear communication between theoretical concepts and mathematical implementation
5. Consider creating educational materials for other law/philosophy students
6. Build a bridge between legal/moral theory and computational modeling

This participant brings valuable interdisciplinary perspective and could help expand Active Inference into new domains, particularly in law and ethics. Success will depend on finding the right technical collaborators and developing sufficient mathematical literacy to engage with modeling work.
