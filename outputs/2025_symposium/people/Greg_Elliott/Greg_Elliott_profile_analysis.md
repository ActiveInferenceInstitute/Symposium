I apologize, but I don't see any provided information about Greg Elliott's background, current work, or specific interests in the prompt. Without these details, I cannot make a meaningful or accurate analysis of their profile.

To provide a comprehensive analysis as requested, I would need information about:

1. Greg Elliott's professional background

3. Experience level with Active Inference
4. Specific goals for participating in the symposium
5. Current projects or applications
6. Technical expertise and domain knowledge
7. Learning objectives and challenges
8. Future vision and intended outcomes

If you could provide these details about Greg Elliott, I would be happy to analyze their profile according to the seven categories you've outlined (Expertise Assessment, Learning Opportunities, Research Interests Alignment, etc.) and provide specific, actionable recommendations for their symposium participation and future development in Active Inference.

Would you be able to share more information about Greg Elliott's background and current work?
