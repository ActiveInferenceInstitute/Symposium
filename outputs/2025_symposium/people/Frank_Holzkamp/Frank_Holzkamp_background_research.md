- **report_type**: background_research

---

After exhaustive multi-source web research, I found very limited publicly available information specifically about **Frank Holzkamp** as a participant in the Active Inference Symposium. The name "Frank Holzkamp" does not appear prominently in major academic databases, institutional profiles, or common research platforms associated with the Active Inference or computational neuroscience communities. The search did not yield direct matches for this individual with detailed academic or professional profiles. Here is a structured summary based on the investigation and inferences from related contexts:

---

### 1. Academic Background

- **Educational History:** No explicit records found for degrees, institutions, or graduation years for Frank Holzkamp.
- **Research Areas and Expertise:** The surname Holzkamp is associated with critical psychology and European meta-theory of subjectivity (e.g., references to labor theory and communication theory in psychology literature), but no clear link to Frank Holzkamp as an active researcher in active inference or related domains [8].
- **Academic Positions:** No institutional affiliations or faculty profiles located to confirm current or past academic appointments.
- **Notable Achievements or Awards:** No announcements or records found.
- **Academic Profiles:** No verified Google Scholar, ORCID, ResearchGate, or institutional academic pages identified.

### 2. Research Contributions

- **Key Publications:** No publications under "Frank Holzkamp" found in databases like Google Scholar, ResearchGate, or PubMed related to active inference or computational neuroscience.
- **Research Focus and Methodologies:** No direct evidence found; however, related literature on critical psychology and subjectivity theory mentioning “Holzkamp” (possibly another individual with similar surname) suggests interests in theoretical psychology rather than active inference per se [8].
- **Citation Metrics:** Not available.
- **Collaborative Networks:** No collaborators or co-author networks identified.
- **Recent Preprints or Working Papers:** None located.

### 3. Professional Experience

- **Employment History:** No LinkedIn or institutional employment data found.
- **Industry Experience or Consulting:** No records.
- **Professional Affiliations:** None identified.
- **Leadership Roles:** No evidence.
- **Patents or Applied Work:** No records.

### 4. Active Inference & Related Research

- No direct publications, presentations, or projects by Frank Holzkamp on active inference were found.
- Literature referencing active inference and free energy principle often cite Karl Friston, Thomas Parr, or other well-known figures in computational neuroscience and theoretical biology but not Holzkamp [2].
- Theoretical overlap with critical psychology and discourse analysis (areas linked with some Holzkamp references) is conceptually distant from mathematical or computational active inference frameworks [1][8].
- No evidence found of Holzkamp addressing research gaps in active inference.

### 5. Academic & Professional Network

- No information about collaborators or joint presentations.
- No conference presentations or workshop participation records.
- No community engagement or open-source repositories identified.
- No social media presence linked to research.

### 6. Online Presence & Resources

- No personal website, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter/X, ORCID, or institutional profile identified for Frank Holzkamp.

### 7. Future Potential & Opportunities

- Due to the absence of documented research activities or outputs in active inference, it is not possible to assess emerging directions or potential impact in this field.
- No strategic collaboration opportunities can be identified without further information.

---

### Additional Notes:
- The surname Holzkamp is notable in critical psychology, especially associated with the late German psychologist **Rainer Holzkamp** (1928–1995), who was influential in critical psychology but unrelated to active inference research [8]. It is possible that Frank Holzkamp is either a different person with minimal digital footprint or a participant with a non-academic or emerging profile.
- The search results include several documents on psychology, critical theory, and active inference concepts but do not connect directly to Frank Holzkamp.
- If Frank Holzkamp is an emerging scholar or professional in this field, their online digital presence might be limited or under different name variations.

If you can provide additional identifiers like ORCID, institutional affiliation, or publication titles, I can refine the search further.
