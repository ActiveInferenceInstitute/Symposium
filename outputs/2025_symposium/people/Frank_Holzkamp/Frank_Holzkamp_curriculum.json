To create a truly personalized and effective curriculum for Frank Holzkamp, I'll need details about:\n\n1. **Background:**\n- Academic/professional background\n- Current field of work/research\n- Level of mathematical/computational expertise\n- Prior exposure to related concepts (e.g., Bayesian inference, machine learning)\n\n2. **Current Active Inference Application:**\n- Specific domain/problem they're working on\n- Current understanding/implementation level\n- Tools/frameworks they're using\n\n3. **Learning Needs:**\n- Specific aspects of Active Inference they want to master\n- Intended application areas\n- Desired level of theoretical vs. practical knowledge\n\n4. **Challenges:**\n- Current obstacles in understanding/implementing Active Inference\n- Time constraints\n- Technical limitations\n\n5. **Pragmatic Value Sought:**\n- Concrete outcomes they want to achieve\n- Practical applications they want to implement\n\n6. **Epistemic Value Sought:**\n- Depth of theoretical understanding desired\n- Research interests\n- Knowledge domains to explore\n\nCould you provide these details so I can design a curriculum that's truly tailored to Frank's specific needs and context? This will help ensure the learning path is relevant, practical, and aligned with his goals.",
