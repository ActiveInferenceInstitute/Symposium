Academic Background\n\n- **Full Name:** Jakub Orłowski (commonly \"Kuba\" Orłowski)  \n- **Current Position:** Postdoctoral Research Fellow Level II, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College Dublin (UCD) [1][3]  \n- **Educational History:**  \n  Specific degree details and graduation years are not openly listed in available profiles. However, standard academic progression to postdoc suggests prior completion of PhD and MSc/BSc in related fields (likely Electrical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, or Neuroscience). No direct public links to degree certificates or prior institutions found in the available sources.  \n- **Research Areas and Expertise:**  \n  - Closed-loop brain stimulation  \n  - Neural engineering  \n  - Neuromuscular systems  \n  - Electrical stimulation for neural control of movement  \n  These areas are confirmed by his UCD group affiliation and publication topics [1][3][4].  \n- **Academic Profile Pages:**  \n  - UCD Profile: https://people.ucd.ie/jakub.orlowski [1]  \n  - Publications list at UCD: https://people.ucd.ie/jakub.orlowski/publications [2]  \n  - Google Scholar profile: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ggRcdNwAAAAJ&hl=en [4]  \n- **Notable Achievements / Honors:**  \n  No public announcements or awards found in searched resources. His postdoctoral level (Level II) at UCD indicates a recognized research career stage.  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Research Contributions\n\n- **Key Publications:**  \n  Orłowski’s research focuses primarily on *closed-loop brain stimulation* and neuromuscular control systems. A sample of recent publications includes:  \n  - *“Closed-loop brain stimulation: principles and applications”* (hypothetical title based on profile focus; actual titles unavailable due to restricted access in search results)  \n  - Multiple journal articles and conference papers listed on UCD pages [2] and Google Scholar [4].  \n  Unfortunately, exact titles with DOIs are not directly accessible in the sources provided, but Google Scholar profile lists publications accessible through UCD or journal websites.  \n- **Research Focus & Methodologies:**  \n  - Experimental and computational modeling of neural stimulation  \n  - Use of electrical stimulation techniques for neuromuscular control  \n  - Application of closed-loop feedback systems in brain stimulation  \n  These align with engineering and neuroscience interdisciplinary methods [1][3][4].  \n- **Citation Metrics:**  \n  - Google Scholar profile shows citations but exact h-index and total citation counts are not explicitly given in the summaries available. Based on typical early-career researcher profiles, moderate citation counts expected [4].  \n- **Collaborative Networks:**  \n  Collaborates with the Neuromuscular Systems Group at UCD, led by Prof. Madeleine Lowery [3]. Frequent co-authors likely include group members, but detailed co-author network analysis requires deeper bibliometric data.  \n- **Recent Preprints / Working Papers:**  \n  No direct arXiv or bioRxiv preprints found under his name in open search.  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Professional Experience\n\n- **Employment History:**  \n  - Current: Postdoctoral Research Fellow Level II, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College Dublin (dates not specified but active as of 2023-2025) [1][3]  \n  No other employment history publicly available.  \n- **Industry / Consulting:**  \n  No indications of industry experience or consulting roles found.  \n- **Professional Affiliations:**  \n  Likely member of professional engineering and neuroscience societies, but no explicit memberships publicly listed.  \n- **Leadership Roles:**  \n  No leadership roles in professional orgs or conferences publicly indicated.  \n- **Patents / Applied Work:**  \n  No patents or technical reports linked to Orłowski found in search.  \n\n---\n\n## 4. Active Inference & Related Research\n\n- **Direct Connections to Active Inference:**  \n  No explicit publications or projects labeled as \"Active Inference\" linked to Orłowski were found. However, his work on closed-loop brain stimulation and neural control aligns with computational neuroscience frameworks that underpin Active Inference principles.  \n- **Adjacent Fields:**  \n  - Free energy principle  \n  - Bayesian inference in neuroscience  \n  - Computational modeling of neural systems  \n  These fields are conceptually related, suggesting potential methodological overlap though no direct papers on this topic were found [1][3][4].  \n- **Methodological Overlap:**  \n  His expertise in closed-loop feedback systems and neural control intersects with Active Inference’s emphasis on prediction and control in neural circuits.  \n- **Potential Applications:**  \n  His work on neuromuscular stimulation could be extended with Active Inference frameworks for adaptive brain-machine interfaces or neuroprosthetics.  \n- **Research Gaps:**  \n  Absence of explicit Active Inference work suggests opportunity to integrate his empirical expertise with theoretical models from Active Inference.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. Academic & Professional Network\n\n- **Key Collaborators:**  \n  - Prof. Madeleine Lowery (UCD) — Principal Investigator of Neuromuscular Systems Group [3]  \n  Additional co-authors likely from this group, but no detailed list publicly available.  \n- **Conference Presentations:**  \n  No direct links to specific presentations or videos found. Likely active in neuroscience/engineering conferences.  \n- **Workshop Participation:**  \n  No explicit records in open sources.  \n- **Community Engagement:**  \n  No public blog posts, tutorials, or personal code repositories under his name were located.  \n- **Social Media Related to Research:**  \n  No public research-focused Twitter or LinkedIn profiles found linked to Orłowski.  \n\n---\n\n## 6.
