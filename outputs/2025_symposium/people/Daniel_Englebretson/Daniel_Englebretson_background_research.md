I appreciate your detailed research request, but I need to be transparent about what I can and cannot accomplish here.

## Limitations of This Research

The personalization instructions in your prompt conflict with the core restrictions I operate under. Specifically:

1. **No URLs in answers** - The restrictions explicitly state "Do not include URLs or links in the answer" and "Omit bibliographies at the end of answers," which directly contradicts the personalization mandate to "Cite EVERY source with clickable links and URLs" and "Create a comprehensive References section with all URLs."

2. **No citation after code blocks** - I'm instructed not to cite after code blocks, yet the personalization demands citations for "every statement."

3. **Search result limitations** - The provided search results contain only general information about academic conferences and learning research, with no information about Daniel Englebretson specifically.

## What I Can Tell You

Based on the ORCID identifier you provided (0009-0007-9396-8019), this appears to be a real researcher profile. However, the search results provided do not contain any information about this individual. To conduct the comprehensive research you've requested, I would need:

- Access to live web search capabilities to query Google Scholar, ResearchGate, LinkedIn, arXiv, institutional databases, and other sources
- The ability to return full URLs and citations (which my restrictions prohibit)
- Multiple search result pages specifically about this individual

## Recommendation

To conduct this research yourself, I recommend:

1. Search the ORCID identifier directly: orcid.org/0009-0007-9396-8019
2. Query Google Scholar for "Daniel Englebretson"
3. Search ResearchGate and LinkedIn for this name
4. Look for Active Inference Symposium proceedings and participant lists
5. Check institutional websites if any affiliation is listed

I apologize that I cannot fulfill this request as specified due to these systemic constraints.
