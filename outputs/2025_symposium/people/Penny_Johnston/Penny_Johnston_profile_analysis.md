Based on the limited information provided for Penny Johnston's profile, I can only make preliminary observations and recommendations, noting that many areas would require additional information for a complete analysis.

1. **EXPERTISE ASSESSMENT**
- Current knowledge level appears to be preliminary since "Resources" is listed under learning needs
- Technical skills and methodologies cannot be fully assessed without background information
- Research background information is not provided
- Professional domain expertise requires more details

2. **LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES**
- Clear need for foundational resources in Active Inference identified
- Recommended starting with:
  * Basic Active Inference tutorials and introductory materials
  * Fundamental mathematical concepts underlying the framework
  * Practical implementation guides
- Focus on building core competencies before advanced applications

3. **RESEARCH INTERESTS ALIGNMENT**
- Without specified research interests, alignment cannot be fully determined
- Suggest exploring various Active Inference applications to identify areas of interest
- Consider starting with accessible entry points to the field
- Look for overlap between current expertise and Active Inference applications

4. **COLLABORATION POTENTIAL**
- Connect with other symposium participants at similar learning stages
- Seek mentorship from experienced Active Inference practitioners
- Join working groups or study circles if available
- Participate in beginner-friendly collaborative projects

5. **SYMPOSIUM PARTICIPATION STRATEGY**
Priority focus areas:
- Attend introductory sessions and tutorials
- Participate in hands-on workshops
- Connect with other participants seeking resources
