I notice that several key fields about Penny Johnston's background, current Active Inference application, learning needs, challenges, and value sought are blank. To create a truly personalized and effective curriculum, I'll need more information about:

1. Her educational/professional background
2. Current knowledge of Active Inference (if any)
3. Specific learning needs and goals
4. Current challenges she's facing
5. What she hopes to achieve (pragmatic outcomes)
6. What she wants to understand (epistemic goals)

Would you be able to provide these details about Penny? This would help me design a curriculum that:

- Starts at the right level
- Focuses on relevant applications
- Addresses specific challenges
- Aligns with her learning style
- Meets her practical needs
- Achieves her desired outcomes

Once you provide this information, I can create a detailed, personalized curriculum following the structure you've outlined, with specific:

- Learning pathways
- Recommended resources
- Practical exercises
- Timeline suggestions
- Assessment methods
- Implementation strategies

Would you please share more details about Penny's background and goals?
