Based on the provided arXiv paper link (which discusses abstraction and Active Inference), I'll create a personalized curriculum for Michael Walters focusing on theoretical understanding and experimental applications of Active Inference, particularly in the context of abstraction and computational modeling.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Strong mathematical/computational background (based on paper authorship)
- Advanced understanding of theoretical frameworks
- Research-oriented perspective
- Gap: Practical implementation of experimental Active Inference models
- Learning style: Mathematical/theoretical with interest in empirical validation

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Timeline: 6-month intensive program
- Month 1-2: Theoretical foundations and mathematical frameworks
- Month 3-4: Computational implementation and tool development
- Month 5-6: Experimental design and empirical validation

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
- Advanced Free Energy Principle mathematics
- Hierarchical generative models
- Abstraction in Active Inference
- Information geometry and variational methods
- Message passing algorithms

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
- Python implementation of Active Inference models
- Using PyTorch for scalable Active Inference
- Designing abstraction experiments
- Building hierarchical inference systems
- Implementation of message passing algorithms

5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**
- Multi-scale Active Inference
- Temporal abstraction in hierarchical models
- Information-theoretic approaches to abstraction
- Mixed discrete-continuous state spaces
- Meta-learning in Active Inference

6. **PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS**
- Experimental design for testing abstraction hypotheses
- Computational modeling of hierarchical inference
- Validation methods for Active Inference models
- Scaling Active Inference to complex domains

7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**
- Active Inference Institute membership
- GitHub repository contributions
- Conference presentations (IWAI, CCN)
- Research collaboration opportunities

8. **ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION**
Milestones:
- Implementing basic Active Inference models

- Active Inference papers database
- Online communities (Active Inference Institute)

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

Short-term (1-3 months):
- Master theoretical foundations
- Implement basic computational models
- Design initial experiments

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Develop novel experimental paradigms
- Create reusable software tools
- Begin empirical validation

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Publish experimental results
- Contribute to theoretical framework
- Establish collaborative projects

This curriculum emphasizes:
- Theoretical depth in Active Inference
- Practical implementation skills
- Experimental design and validation
- Community engagement and contribution
- Research output and publication

The focus is on bridging theory and practice through experimental validation of Active Inference models, particularly in the context of abstraction and hierarchical inference.
