I apologize, but I notice that most of the profile fields for Michael Walters are empty, with only the arxiv link provided. Additionally, when I try to access the provided arxiv link (2502.04249), I get an error as this appears to be an invalid or non-existent paper number. Without more specific information about Michael Walters' background, interests, and goals, I can only provide a very limited analysis.

However, I can outline a general framework for how to approach the analysis once more information becomes available:

1. **EXPERTISE ASSESSMENT**
- Need more information about their current work and background
- Would need to review their publications and research history
- Technical skills inventory would be valuable

2. **LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES**
- Would need to understand their current knowledge level to identify gaps
- Could suggest foundational Active Inference resources depending on background
- Technical skill development recommendations would depend on current expertise

3. **RESEARCH INTERESTS ALIGNMENT**
- Cannot determine specific alignments without more information
- Would need to know their current research focus and interests
- Could explore potential applications once field of expertise is known

4. **COLLABORATION POTENTIAL**
- Would need to know their specific expertise to identify complementary partnerships
- Community engagement opportunities would depend on their background and interests

5. **SYMPOSIUM PARTICIPATION STRATEGY**
- Would tailor recommendations based on expertise level and interests
- General suggestion would be to focus on foundational sessions if new to Active Inference

6. **DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP**
- Would need to understand current position and goals to create meaningful roadmap
- Could develop once more information is available

7. **ACTIVE INFERENCE INTEGRATION**
- Integration strategies would depend on their field and current work
- Would need more context to provide specific recommendations

To provide a more detailed and useful analysis, I would need:
- Current research interests and background
- Technical expertise level
- Professional domain
- Goals for engaging with Active Inference
- Current knowledge of Active Inference
- Specific challenges or problems they're trying to address
