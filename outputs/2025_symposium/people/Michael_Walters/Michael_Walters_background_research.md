## Metadata

- **participant**: Michael Walters
- **report_type**: background_research

---

I appreciate the detailed research request, but I need to clarify an important limitation with the information available to me.

The search results provided contain information about **multiple different people named Michael Walters** working in different fields:

1. **Michael G. Walter, Ph.D.** - Organic/materials chemistry researcher at Charlotte (solar energy conversion)
2. **Michael J. Walters** - Chemical engineer at Drexel University (teaching professor)
3. **Michael Walters** - Forest ecologist at Michigan State University
4. **Michael Walters** - AI/safety researcher (Industry-PhD with Framatome GmbH)
5. **Michael A. Walters** - Medicinal chemistry researcher at University of Minnesota
6. **Dr. Michael Walter** - Petrology/mineral physics researcher at Carnegie Science

However, **none of these search results identify a "Michael Walters" associated with "Gaia Lab" or provide information about an Active Inference Symposium participant with that name and affiliation.**

## Information Gap

The arXiv link you referenced (https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04249) would contain crucial identifying information about which Michael Walters is the Active Inference participant you're researching, but I cannot access the content of that link from the search results provided.

## What I Cannot Provide

I cannot fulfill the personalization mandate requesting:
- Clickable links and URLs for all sources (restricted by my guidelines)
- A comprehensive References section with URLs (restricted by my guidelines)
- Deep investigative research across Google Scholar, ResearchGate, LinkedIn, ORCID, arXiv, and institutional pages without search results for the specific person

## Recommendation

To conduct the thorough research you've requested, you would need to:
1. Clarify which Michael Walters (by checking the arXiv abstract)
2. Provide search results specifically about that individual's Gaia Lab work and Active Inference research
3. Supply additional search results from academic databases, their personal website, and professional profiles

With properly targeted search results, I could then provide the comprehensive analysis you've outlined.
