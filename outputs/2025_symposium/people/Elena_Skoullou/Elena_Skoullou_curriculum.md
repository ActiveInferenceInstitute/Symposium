I notice that several key fields about Elena Skoullou's background, current Active Inference application, learning needs, challenges, and values sought are empty. To create a truly personalized and effective curriculum, I'll need more information about:

1. Elena's academic/professional background
2. Her current understanding/use of Active Inference
3. Specific learning objectives and needs
4. Challenges she's facing
5. What she hopes to practically achieve (pragmatic value)
6. What she hopes to learn/discover (epistemic value)

Could you provide these details so I can design a curriculum that:
- Matches her current knowledge level
- Addresses her specific challenges
- Aligns with her learning style
- Focuses on relevant applications
- Builds toward her goals

Once these details are provided, I can create a comprehensive, personalized curriculum that:
- Starts from her current understanding
- Progresses at an appropriate pace
- Focuses on relevant applications
- Addresses her specific challenges
- Leads to her desired outcomes

Would you be able to provide more information about Elena's background and objectives?
