I notice that several key pieces of information are missing from the participant profile. To create a truly personalized and effective curriculum for Jorge Esteves, I'll need details about:

1. Their background (academic/professional experience)
2. Current Active Inference application interests/needs
3. Specific learning needs
4. Challenges they're facing
5. Their pragmatic and epistemic goals

Would you please provide these details so I can design a curriculum that:
- Matches their current knowledge level
- Addresses their specific challenges
- Aligns with their application interests
- Meets their learning style
- Achieves their desired outcomes

Once you share this information, I can create a detailed, personalized curriculum following the comprehensive structure you've outlined, with specific:
- Learning paths
- Timeline recommendations
- Resource selections
- Practical exercises
- Implementation strategies

This will ensure the curriculum is maximally relevant and effective for Jorge's specific situation and goals.

Would you please provide the missing background information?
