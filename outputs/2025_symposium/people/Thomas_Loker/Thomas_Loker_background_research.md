### 2. Research Contributions

- **Key Concepts and Frameworks:**
  - *1TrueU*: A dynamic confidence index (CI) for zero-click authentication in identity systems.
  - *Markov Blanket Security*: A security framework based on predictive, outcome-first protection aligned with the Free Energy Principle.
  - *Individually-Centric Fractal Architecture (ICFA)*: Hierarchical blankets spanning devices, individuals, and personal networks.
  - *Outcome vs. Context Framework*: Reduces dependency on external context for identity decisions using a CI Corridor between ELBO and CUBE bounds.
  - *Thing Hash* (patent family): Multi-vector device identity system validated across 1TrueU devices without cloud fingerprinting.

  - Holds a patent family related to *Thing Hash*, a device identity system (details not publicly linked but referenced in IC-Corp documentation).
  - Develops technology grounded in principles of free energy and active inference applied to security and identity [3].

- **Professional Affiliations:**
  - No formal professional society memberships listed.
  - Active in entrepreneurial and angel investment communities [1].

### 4. Active Inference & Related Research

- **Direct Connections:**
  - The *Markov Blanket Security* concept is explicitly based on the Free Energy Principle and active inference frameworks.
  - Applies active inference principles to design predictive, adaptive identity and security systems that anticipate outcomes rather than react to external context [3].

- **Methodological Overlap:**
  - Uses Bayesian inference and hierarchical models (fractal architecture) consistent with computational neuroscience approaches to active inference.
  - Digital Plasticity concept aligns with adaptive behavior modeling in dynamic environments.

- **Applications:**
  - His frameworks address digital identity trust anchors, zero-click authentication, and privacy-first architectures.
  - Positions his work as foundational for frictionless, individually sovereign digital experiences.

- **Research Gaps:**
  - Bridges theory of active inference with practical identity/security system design.
  - Focus on outcome-first security minimizes reliance on traditional external context, a novel approach in the field.

### 5. Academic & Professional Network

- **Collaborators:**
  - Collaboration primarily within IC-Corp and entrepreneurial networks.
  - Contact for collaborations: Thomas Ramar, CISO at IC-Corp [3].

- **Conference Presentations:**
