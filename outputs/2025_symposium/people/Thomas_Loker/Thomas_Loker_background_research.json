Academic Background\n\n- **Education:**\n  - Bachelor of Science (BS) in Life Sciences from the University of Lynchburg (1973–1977) [source: Individual Centricity Corporation org chart][1].\n  - Studied Microbiology at Georgetown University (1977–1979); no specific degree noted [1].\n\n- **Research Areas & Expertise:**\n  - Focuses on *individually-centric identity systems*, *data sovereignty*, and concepts such as *Digital Plasticity*, *Markov Blanket Security*, and *Individually-Centric Fractal Architecture*.\n  - His work is grounded in the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and active inference, applying these to identity and security frameworks.\n  - Self-described as a semi-retired entrepreneur, writer, and mentor specializing in adaptive identity systems [3].\n\n- **Academic Positions:**\n  - No formal or current academic appointments found.\n  - Primarily operates through Individual Centricity Corporation as CEO and founder [1][3].\n\n- **Notable Academic Profiles:**\n  - Google Scholar profile (Verified): https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gvmKFVAAAAAJ&hl=en [4].\n  - ORCID: 0009-0001-2695-0691 (verified via user data).\n  - ResearchGate presence noted but no extensive academic publications listed publicly.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Research Contributions\n\n- **Key Concepts and Frameworks:**\n  - *1TrueU*: A dynamic confidence index (CI) for zero-click authentication in identity systems.\n  - *Markov Blanket Security*: A security framework based on predictive, outcome-first protection aligned with the Free Energy Principle.\n  - *Individually-Centric Fractal Architecture (ICFA)*: Hierarchical blankets spanning devices, individuals, and personal networks.\n  - *Outcome vs. Context Framework*: Reduces dependency on external context for identity decisions using a CI Corridor between ELBO and CUBE bounds.\n  - *Thing Hash* (patent family): Multi-vector device identity system validated across 1TrueU devices without cloud fingerprinting.\n\n- **Publications:**\n  - No peer-reviewed academic journal articles indexed on Google Scholar or ResearchGate.\n  - Writes extensively on Medium and his personal platform about consciousness, active inference, and privacy-first digital identity.\n  - ResearchGate spotlight available but limited formal publication records.\n\n- **Citation Metrics:**\n  - Google Scholar shows limited academic citation data; presence is primarily for dissemination rather than traditional academic impact [4].\n\n- **Collaborative Networks:**\n  - Does not appear to have formal co-authorship networks in academic literature.\n  - Collaborates within industry and entrepreneurial networks, including IC-Corp and angel investor groups [1].\n\n---\n\n### 3. Professional Experience\n\n- **Current Role:**\n  - Co-Founder, Chairperson, and CEO at Individual Centricity Corporation (IC-Corp), a company focused on individually-centric digital identity and data sovereignty [1][3].\n\n- **Career History:**\n  - Benefit Manager at Harmony & Healing.\n  - Board Member at Thomsen's Manufacturing LLC.\n  - Startup Consultant and Advisor at SYDK.ORG.\n  - Angel Investor, Mentor, Advisor at Keiretsu Forum and Venture-Med.\n  - Leadership roles including EVP Operations & General Manager, COO at various companies such as David Victor Presents, ImpactFlow, Prime Genomics, Ramsell Corporation, and ICOM3, Inc. [1].\n\n- **Patents and Technical Work:**\n  - Holds a patent family related to *Thing Hash*, a device identity system (details not publicly linked but referenced in IC-Corp documentation).\n  - Develops technology grounded in principles of free energy and active inference applied to security and identity [3].\n\n- **Professional Affiliations:**\n  - No formal professional society memberships listed.\n  - Active in entrepreneurial and angel investment communities [1].\n\n---\n\n### 4. Active Inference & Related Research\n\n- **Direct Connections:**\n  - The *Markov Blanket Security* concept is explicitly based on the Free Energy Principle and active inference frameworks.\n  - Applies active inference principles to design predictive, adaptive identity and security systems that anticipate outcomes rather than react to external context [3].\n\n- **Methodological Overlap:**\n  - Uses Bayesian inference and hierarchical models (fractal architecture) consistent with computational neuroscience approaches to active inference.\n  - Digital Plasticity concept aligns with adaptive behavior modeling in dynamic environments.\n\n- **Applications:**\n  - His frameworks address digital identity trust anchors, zero-click authentication, and privacy-first architectures.\n  - Positions his work as foundational for frictionless, individually sovereign digital experiences.\n\n- **Research Gaps:**\n  - Bridges theory of active inference with practical identity/security system design.\n  - Focus on outcome-first security minimizes reliance on traditional external context, a novel approach in the field.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Academic & Professional Network\n\n- **Collaborators:**\n  - Collaboration primarily within IC-Corp and entrepreneurial networks.\n  - Contact for collaborations: Thomas Ramar, CISO at IC-Corp [3].\n\n- **Conference Presentations:**\n  - Participated in Active Inference Symposium; no direct links to presentation videos found.\n  - No major academic conference proceedings indexed.\n\n- **Community Engagement:**\n  - Active on Medium with essays on consciousness and active inference.\n  - Publishes economic and editorial articles on twlnews.com.\n  - No public GitHub or code repositories found.\n\n- **Social Media:**\n  - No verified LinkedIn or Twitter profiles publicly linked.\n  - Contactable via email: thomas@loker.com.\n\n---\n\n### 6.
