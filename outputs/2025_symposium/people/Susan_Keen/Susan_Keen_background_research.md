- **Research Areas & Expertise**:  
  Keen specializes in teaching and research on animal diversity, evolution, and organismal biology. Her interests include promoting STEM undergraduate success, especially for first-generation college students. She also focuses on pedagogical methods, visual media in biology education, and educational support models in STEM[1][2].

- **Current Position**:  
  She is a **Professor of Teaching** in the Department of Evolution and Ecology at UC Davis. She has worked at UC Davis since at least 1993, serving as Lecturer, Director of Introductory Biology, and Associate Dean for Undergraduate Academic Programs (2012–2018)[1][2].

- **Notable Achievements**:  
  - Graduate Student Teaching Award (1991) at UC Davis for outstanding teaching during her Ph.D. studies[1].  
  - Lead author on two biology textbooks: *Animal Diversity* and *Integrated Principles of Zoology*, including lab manuals[1][2].  
  - NSF-funded Research Collaborative Network (VISABLI) on visual media in biology teaching[2].

DOI not available but journal link: [Taylor & Francis](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00219266.2025.2523348?af=R) [2][3]  
  - Contributed chapters to *Integrated Principles of Zoology* and co-authored *Animal Diversity* textbook editions[1][2].

- **Research Focus & Methodologies**:  
  Keen’s work centers on STEM education research, particularly strategies to improve academic success for underrepresented students, development of co-classes to aid first-generation students, and use of visual media to enhance comprehension in biology[2].

- **Citation Metrics**:  
  There is no publicly accessible Google Scholar profile with citation metrics for Susan Keen. Her work is primarily in education and pedagogy, which often have different citation patterns than experimental biology.

- **Collaborative Networks**:  
  Frequent collaborators include Joel Ledford (co-classes and STEM education), Jodie Jenkinson and Gael McGill (VISABLI NSF project)[2]. These colleagues work at UC Davis and partner institutions.

- **Recent Preprints / Working Papers**:  
  No records found on arXiv, bioRxiv, or SSRN indicating preprints or working papers. Keen’s work appears primarily published in education journals and textbooks.

## 4. Active Inference & Related Research

- **Direct Connections to Active Inference**:  
  No direct publications or presentations on Active Inference, free energy principle, Bayesian inference, or computational neuroscience were found in Keen’s profile or publication record.

- **Adjacent Fields**:  
  Keen’s expertise lies in biological education, evolution, and animal diversity rather than computational neuroscience or theoretical biology central to Active Inference.

- **Methodological Overlap**:  
  No evidence of mathematical modeling, simulations, or computational frameworks related to Active Inference in her work.

- **Potential Applications to Active Inference**:  
  While Keen’s work focuses on biology education, particularly organismal biology and evolution, there is no direct overlap with Active Inference methodologies.

- **Research Gaps to Address**:  
  Keen’s expertise could potentially contribute pedagogical insights or educational frameworks to Active Inference training but no current active involvement is evident.

## 7. Future Potential & Opportunities

- Keen’s recent interests focus on STEM undergraduate success, particularly first-generation students, and improving biology education through visual media and pedagogical innovations[2].

- Although not directly involved in Active Inference research, her expertise in teaching organismal biology and evolution could support educational efforts within the Active Inference community, such as developing biology-based curricula or training materials.

- Opportunities exist for interdisciplinary collaboration integrating biology education with computational neuroscience, potentially addressing educational gaps in computational modeling for biology students.

- Strategic collaborations could involve pairing Keen’s educational expertise with computational Active Inference researchers to enhance teaching effectiveness and student engagement.
