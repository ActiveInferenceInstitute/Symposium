Keen**, participant in the Active Inference Symposium, affiliated with University of California Davis, ORCID: 0000-0002-4670-5271.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Academic Background\n\n- **Education**:  \n  Susan Keen earned her Ph.D. in Biology from the University of California, Davis in 1991[1]. There is no publicly listed information on her undergraduate education.\n\n- **Research Areas & Expertise**:  \n  Keen specializes in teaching and research on animal diversity, evolution, and organismal biology. Her interests include promoting STEM undergraduate success, especially for first-generation college students. She also focuses on pedagogical methods, visual media in biology education, and educational support models in STEM[1][2].\n\n- **Current Position**:  \n  She is a **Professor of Teaching** in the Department of Evolution and Ecology at UC Davis. She has worked at UC Davis since at least 1993, serving as Lecturer, Director of Introductory Biology, and Associate Dean for Undergraduate Academic Programs (2012–2018)[1][2].\n\n- **Notable Achievements**:  \n  - Graduate Student Teaching Award (1991) at UC Davis for outstanding teaching during her Ph.D. studies[1].  \n  - Lead author on two biology textbooks: *Animal Diversity* and *Integrated Principles of Zoology*, including lab manuals[1][2].  \n  - NSF-funded Research Collaborative Network (VISABLI) on visual media in biology teaching[2].\n\n- **Academic Profiles**:  \n  - UC Davis Academic Federation: [Link](https://academicfederation.ucdavis.edu/susan-keen)  \n  - UC Davis Biology Department: [Link](https://biology.ucdavis.edu/people/susan-keen)  \n  - ORCID: [0000-0002-4670-5271](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4670-5271)  \n  - Aggie Experts (UC Davis expert directory): [Link](https://experts.ucdavis.edu/expert/af77xC2C)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Research Contributions\n\n- **Key Publications** (selected recent and notable):  \n  - Ledford J., Keen S., Motika M., Hou X. (2020). *Companion Classes as a Support Model in Introductory Biology and Chemistry*. Journal of First Year Experience & Students in Transition, 32, 59-76. DOI not available but journal link: [Taylor & Francis](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00219266.2025.2523348?af=R) [2][3]  \n  - Contributed chapters to *Integrated Principles of Zoology* and co-authored *Animal Diversity* textbook editions[1][2].\n\n- **Research Focus & Methodologies**:  \n  Keen’s work centers on STEM education research, particularly strategies to improve academic success for underrepresented students, development of co-classes to aid first-generation students, and use of visual media to enhance comprehension in biology[2].\n\n- **Citation Metrics**:  \n  There is no publicly accessible Google Scholar profile with citation metrics for Susan Keen. Her work is primarily in education and pedagogy, which often have different citation patterns than experimental biology.\n\n- **Collaborative Networks**:  \n  Frequent collaborators include Joel Ledford (co-classes and STEM education), Jodie Jenkinson and Gael McGill (VISABLI NSF project)[2]. These colleagues work at UC Davis and partner institutions.\n\n- **Recent Preprints / Working Papers**:  \n  No records found on arXiv, bioRxiv, or SSRN indicating preprints or working papers. Keen’s work appears primarily published in education journals and textbooks.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Professional Experience\n\n- **Employment History**:  \n  - Lecturer and Director for Introductory Biology at UC Davis since 1993[1].  \n  - Associate Dean for Undergraduate Academic Programs, College of Biological Sciences, UC Davis (2012–2018)[2].  \n  - Professor of Teaching, Evolution and Ecology, UC Davis (current)[2].\n\n- **Industry or Consulting Work**:  \n  No evidence found of industry experience or consulting engagements.\n\n- **Professional Affiliations & Leadership**:  \n  - Active in academic teaching committees at UC Davis, including Teaching Resources Center discussion groups on pedagogy[1].  \n  - No publicly listed memberships in professional societies (e.g., Society for Neuroscience, Cognitive Science Society) or leadership roles beyond university-level.\n\n- **Patents / Technical Reports**:  \n  None identified.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Active Inference & Related Research\n\n- **Direct Connections to Active Inference**:  \n  No direct publications or presentations on Active Inference, free energy principle, Bayesian inference, or computational neuroscience were found in Keen’s profile or publication record.\n\n- **Adjacent Fields**:  \n  Keen’s expertise lies in biological education, evolution, and animal diversity rather than computational neuroscience or theoretical biology central to Active Inference.\n\n- **Methodological Overlap**:  \n  No evidence of mathematical modeling, simulations, or computational frameworks related to Active Inference in her work.\n\n- **Potential Applications to Active Inference**:  \n  While Keen’s work focuses on biology education, particularly organismal biology and evolution, there is no direct overlap with Active Inference methodologies.\n\n- **Research Gaps to Address**:  \n  Keen’s expertise could potentially contribute pedagogical insights or educational frameworks to Active Inference training but no current active involvement is evident.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Academic & Professional Network\n\n- **Key Collaborators**:  \n  - Joel Ledford (UC Davis, STEM education)  \n  - Jodie Jenkinson and Gael McGill (co-PI on NSF VISABLI project)[2]\n\n- **Conference Presentations & Workshops**:  \n  Specific conference participations or presentations related to Active Inference or biological education are not publicly listed.\n\n- **Community Engagement**:  \n  Keen has contributed to textbook development, teaching courses on pedagogy, and university discussions to enhance STEM education environments[1][2].\n\n- **Social Media Presence**:  \n  No public Twitter, LinkedIn, or GitHub profiles specifically related to research found.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Online Presence & Resources\n\n| Resource                  | Link                                                         |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| UC Davis Academic Profile  | [Link](https://academicfederation.ucdavis.edu/susan-keen)    |\n| UC Davis Biology Profile  | [Link](https://biology.ucdavis.edu/people/susan-keen)        |\n| ORCID                    | [Link](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4670-5271)                |\n| Aggie Experts (UC Davis) | [Link](https://experts.ucdavis.edu/expert/af77xC2C)          |\n| Publication Example       | [Taylor & Francis Journal](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00219266.2025.2523348?af=R) |\n\nNo personal website, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, LinkedIn, GitHub, or Twitter profiles publicly available.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Future Potential & Opportunities\n\n- Keen’s recent interests focus on STEM undergraduate success, particularly first-generation students, and improving biology education through visual media and pedagogical innovations[2].\n\n- Although not directly involved in Active Inference research, her expertise in teaching organismal biology and evolution could support educational efforts within the Active Inference community, such as developing biology-based curricula or training materials.\n\n- Opportunities exist for interdisciplinary collaboration integrating biology education with computational neuroscience, potentially addressing educational gaps in computational modeling for biology students.\n\n- Strategic collaborations could involve pairing Keen’s educational expertise with computational Active Inference researchers to enhance teaching effectiveness and student engagement.\n\n---\n\n# References\n\n1.
