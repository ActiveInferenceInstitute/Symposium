## 4. Active Inference & Related Research

- **Direct Links to Active Inference:**
  - Although no publication explicitly titled with "Active Inference," Lin’s work on computational psychiatry, dopamine signaling, and decision-making overlaps methodologically with Active Inference frameworks, which integrate Bayesian inference and free energy principles in brain function modeling.  
  - Dopaminergic role in risky decision-making and mood traits aligns with Active Inference themes of brain predictive coding and decision processes.  
  - The 2024 *Computational Psychiatry* publication connects to computational modeling paradigms that are foundational to Active Inference research.  
  [Lin & Dolan 2024](https://doi.org/10.1162/cpsy_a_00139)  
  [PNAS co-authored article](https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.2500815122)

- **Adjacent Fields:**
  - Free energy principle and Bayesian inference implicitly underpin computational psychiatry methods in Lin’s research.  
  - Utilizes functional neuroimaging and electrophysiology to probe computational models of brain function.  

- **Methodological Overlap:**
  - Modeling and simulation of decision processes and mood-related biases.  
  - Use of mathematical frameworks for outcome sensitivity and value representation in neural circuits.  

- **Potential Applications:**
  - Understanding neuropsychiatric disorders through dopamine system dysfunction.  
  - Clinical intervention design for pathological risky behaviors.
