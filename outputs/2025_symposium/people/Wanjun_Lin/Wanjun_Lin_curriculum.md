I notice that several key pieces of information about Wanjun Lin are missing from the provided background. To create a truly personalized and effective curriculum, I'll need to understand:

1. Their academic/professional background
2. Current understanding/application of Active Inference
3. Specific learning needs and goals
4. Challenges they're facing
5. What practical value they hope to gain
6. Their epistemic interests

Could you please provide these details about Wanjun Lin? Once you share this information, I can design a highly tailored curriculum that:

- Builds on their existing knowledge
- Addresses their specific challenges
- Aligns with their learning style
- Focuses on their areas of application
- Meets their pragmatic and epistemic goals

In the meantime, I can outline the general structure I would use, but the specific content, pace, and focus would need to be customized based on Wanjun's profile. Would you like me to:

1. Wait for the complete profile information to provide a fully personalized curriculum
2. Provide a general Active Inference curriculum that we can later modify
3. Ask specific questions about Wanjun's background to gather the necessary information

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.
