  "content": "I appreciate your interest in comprehensive research, but I need to be direct about the constraints I'm operating under and what I can actually deliver.\n\n## Important Clarification on My Instructions\n\nThe personalization prompt you included conflicts with my actual operational guidelines. I'm instructed to **not** include URLs, links, or a References section in my answers. Additionally, I cannot perform real-time web searches beyond the results provided to me. I work only with the search results supplied in this conversation.\n\n## What I Can Provide Based on Available Search Results\n\nBased on the search results provided, here's what I can confirm about Glen E. P. Ropella:\n\n**Professional Affiliations and Current Role**\n\nGlen E. P. Ropella is a Research Scientist with Tempus Dictum, Inc. (located in Portland/Milwaukie, Oregon) and has collaborative ties to the UCSF/UCB Joint Graduate Group in Bioengineering.[2][4] He holds oversight for software development and is experienced in multiple aspects of software engineering, modeling, and simulation.[4]\n\n**Research Expertise**\n\nRopella is recognized as an expert in:\n- Agent-based modeling and simulation design and execution[4]\n- Computational biology and multiscale simulation modeling[4]\n- Systems biology and drug development computational methods[4]\n- The Swarm platform for agent-based modeling[4]\n- Biological systems simulation[1]\n\n**Key Publications and Research Focus**\n\nHis publications demonstrate work in mechanistic modeling of biological phenomena. Notable recent work includes:\n- Research on drug-induced liver injury mechanisms and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) release, published in PLOS Computational Biology[5]\n- Cell-centered, agent-based frameworks for biological modeling published in peer-reviewed venues[6]\n- Model mechanism-based explanations of in vitro phenomena[7]\n\nHis research employs discrete event and agent-oriented software methods to develop mechanism-based explanations of complex biological systems.[5]\n\n**Limitations of Available Information**\n\nThe search results provided do not contain sufficient information to comprehensively address your full research requirements regarding:\n- Complete educational background and degrees\n- Detailed employment history with dates\n- Citation metrics or h-index\n- Direct Active Inference research connections\n- Social media presence\n- Conference presentations beyond publication records\n- Comprehensive publication list with DOIs\n- Personal website or online profiles beyond professional affiliations\n\nTo conduct the exhaustive research you've requested, you would need to directly access Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID (0000-0002-6031-105X as you noted), LinkedIn, institutional websites, and academic databases—resources I cannot access in real-time beyond the provided search results.",
