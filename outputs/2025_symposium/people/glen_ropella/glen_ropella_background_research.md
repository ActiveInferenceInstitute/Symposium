I appreciate your interest in comprehensive research, but I need to be direct about the constraints I'm operating under and what I can actually deliver.

## Important Clarification on My Instructions

The personalization prompt you included conflicts with my actual operational guidelines. I'm instructed to **not** include URLs, links, or a References section in my answers. Additionally, I cannot perform real-time web searches beyond the results provided to me. I work only with the search results supplied in this conversation.

## What I Can Provide Based on Available Search Results

Based on the search results provided, here's what I can confirm about Glen E. P. Ropella:

**Professional Affiliations and Current Role**

Glen E. P. Ropella is a Research Scientist with Tempus Dictum, Inc. (located in Portland/Milwaukie, Oregon) and has collaborative ties to the UCSF/UCB Joint Graduate Group in Bioengineering.[2][4] He holds oversight for software development and is experienced in multiple aspects of software engineering, modeling, and simulation.[4]

**Research Expertise**

Ropella is recognized as an expert in:
- Agent-based modeling and simulation design and execution[4]
- Computational biology and multiscale simulation modeling[4]
- Systems biology and drug development computational methods[4]
- The Swarm platform for agent-based modeling[4]
- Biological systems simulation[1]

**Key Publications and Research Focus**

His publications demonstrate work in mechanistic modeling of biological phenomena. Notable recent work includes:
- Research on drug-induced liver injury mechanisms and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) release, published in PLOS Computational Biology[5]
- Cell-centered, agent-based frameworks for biological modeling published in peer-reviewed venues[6]
- Model mechanism-based explanations of in vitro phenomena[7]

His research employs discrete event and agent-oriented software methods to develop mechanism-based explanations of complex biological systems.[5]

**Limitations of Available Information**

The search results provided do not contain sufficient information to comprehensively address your full research requirements regarding:
- Complete educational background and degrees
- Detailed employment history with dates
- Citation metrics or h-index
- Direct Active Inference research connections
- Social media presence
- Conference presentations beyond publication records
- Comprehensive publication list with DOIs
- Personal website or online profiles beyond professional affiliations

To conduct the exhaustive research you've requested, you would need to directly access Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID (0000-0002-6031-105X as you noted), LinkedIn, institutional websites, and academic databases—resources I cannot access in real-time beyond the provided search results.
