Based on Glen's background in biological systems simulation and interest in semi-formal languages for conceptual models, I'll design a personalized Active Inference curriculum that emphasizes practical modeling frameworks while providing broad exposure to the field.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Strong in: Complex systems simulation, biological modeling
- To develop: Formal frameworks of Active Inference, information theory
- Learning style: Likely systematic and model-oriented given simulation background

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Months 1-2: Foundations
- Free Energy Principle fundamentals
- Markov Decision Processes
- Information geometry basics

Months 3-4: Modeling Frameworks
- Formal model specification languages
- Bayesian modeling approaches
- Message passing algorithms

Months 5-6: Implementation & Application

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
a) Foundational Framework
- Variational Free Energy
- Belief updating and learning
- Action selection

b) Modeling Languages
- Category theory basics
