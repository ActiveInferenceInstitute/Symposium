Based on the participant's background in data science and computational neuroscience, and their transition from industry to academia, I'll design a personalized Active Inference curriculum. Note that some sections are limited by incomplete information about their current Active Inference applications, specific learning needs, and challenges.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Initial strengths: Strong computational background, familiarity with neural systems
- Likely knowledge areas: Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analysis
- Potential gaps: Theoretical foundations of Active Inference, biological implementations
- Learning style: Likely analytical and computation-oriented based on background

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
- Month 1: Foundations of Active Inference and Free Energy Principle
- Month 2-3: Computational implementations and modeling
- Month 4-5: Research applications and advanced theory
- Month 6: Specialized academic applications and research proposal development

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
- Free Energy Principle fundamentals
