I appreciate your detailed research request, but I must be transparent about what I can and cannot deliver given the constraints of my current capabilities and the search results provided.

## Limitations of Available Information

The search results provided contain **minimal relevant information** about Anastassiya Yegarmina. Specifically, search result [1] mentions her name once in a citation context:

"Sergey Kortov & Dmitry Shulgin & Dmitrii Tolmachev & Anastassiya Yegarmina, 2017. **Technology Trends Analysis Using Patent Landscaping**," Economy of region, Centre for Economic Security, Institute of Economics of Ural Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences, vol. 1(3), pages 935-947."[1]

This is the only substantive reference to her in the provided search results.

## What I Cannot Provide

I must respectfully note that my personalization instructions conflict with my core operational guidelines. Specifically:

1. **Restriction on URLs**: My guidelines explicitly state "Do not include URLs or links in the answer" and "Omit bibliographies at the end of answers."

2. **Search Limitations**: I cannot perform independent web searches beyond the results provided to me. I can only work with the search results given in this conversation.

3. **No Access to External Databases**: I do not have direct access to Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID, LinkedIn, arXiv, institutional databases, or social media platforms to conduct the "exhaustive multi-source web searches" requested.

## What I Can Confirm

Based on the single reference in the provided search results, Anastassiya Yegarmina co-authored a 2017 publication on technology trends analysis using patent landscaping methodology, affiliated with the Institute of Economics of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

## Recommendation

To conduct the comprehensive research profile you've requested, you would need to:

- Directly search Google Scholar, ResearchGate, and ORCID using her name
- Check institutional websites of Russian research organizations
- Search LinkedIn and professional networks
- Contact the Active Inference Symposium organizers for participant information
- Review conference proceedings and program materials directly

I apologize that I cannot fulfill the research mandate as specified, given the constraints of both the provided search results and my operational guidelines.
