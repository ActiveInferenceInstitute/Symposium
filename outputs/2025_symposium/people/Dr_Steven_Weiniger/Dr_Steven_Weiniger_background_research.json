  "content": "I appreciate your detailed research request, but I need to clarify an important limitation with my current capabilities and the search results provided.\n\n## Current Limitations\n\nThe search results provided contain information exclusively about Dr. Steven Weiniger's work in **posture, biomechanics, and chiropractic practice**—not Active Inference, computational neuroscience, or related theoretical frameworks. While the personalization instructions request exhaustive multi-source research with clickable links and DOIs, I must be transparent about what the available data actually shows.\n\n## What the Search Results Reveal\n\n**Educational Background:**\nDr. Steven Weiniger graduated from New York Chiropractic College[1][2][7] and currently serves as a postgraduate instructor at the University of Western States[1][2][7].\n\n**Professional Focus:**\nHis expertise centers on posture rehabilitation, biomechanics, and exercise integration rather than Active Inference or computational neuroscience. He is the lead instructor for the Certified Posture Exercise Professional (CPEP) certification[1][2] and authored *Stand Taller Live Longer*[1][5].\n\n**Clinical Background:**\nAccording to the self-reported information in your query, Dr. Weiniger practiced as a doctor of chiropractic for 26 years and has been lecturing for the past 20 years.\n\n**Recent Publication:**\nThe 2024 publication you referenced—Weiniger, S. P., & Schilaty, N. D. (2024). \"Interoceptive posture awareness and accuracy: a novel photographic strategy towards making posture actionable.\" *Frontiers in Neuroscience*, 18, 1359594—appears to represent a shift toward neuroscience-focused research, though the search results do not contain details about this paper.\n\n## Critical Gap\n\nThe search results do not provide:\n- Active Inference publications or presentations\n- Computational modeling work\n- Connections to the free energy principle or Bayesian frameworks\n- Google Scholar profile with citation metrics\n- ORCID profile details (beyond the identifier you provided)\n- ResearchGate or LinkedIn profiles\n- GitHub repositories\n- Twitter/X presence\n- Detailed institutional profile pages with research statements\n\n## Recommendation\n\nTo conduct the comprehensive research you've requested, I would need access to:\n1. Direct search results from Google Scholar for his ORCID (0000-0003-2073-5461)\n2. His institutional profile page at University of Western States\n3. The full text or abstract of the 2024 *Frontiers in Neuroscience* publication\n4. Any Active Inference Symposium materials or conference proceedings\n5. His ResearchGate and LinkedIn profiles\n\nThe current search results, while detailed about his posture and chiropractic expertise, do not support the comprehensive Active Inference-focused analysis you've requested. I cannot generate citations or links to research that isn't present in the provided search results, as doing so would violate the accuracy requirements of my guidelines.",
