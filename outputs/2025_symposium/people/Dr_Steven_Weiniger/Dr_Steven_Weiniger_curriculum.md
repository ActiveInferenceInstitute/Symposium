Based on Dr. Weiniger's background in chiropractic medicine, focus on somatic awareness, and interest in behavioral change, I'll design a personalized Active Inference curriculum that bridges clinical practice with theoretical frameworks.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Strong foundation in clinical practice and somatic awareness
- Extensive experience in behavioral modification and patient education
- Limited exposure to formal Active Inference theory
- Learning style likely favors practical, clinically-relevant applications
- Strong teaching/communication background

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Month 1-2: Foundations
- Active Inference fundamentals through clinical lens
- Mapping interoception to Free Energy Principle
- Basic computational concepts using clinical examples

Month 3-4: Clinical Applications
- Behavioral modeling in patient care
- Integration with existing clinical frameworks
- Practical implementation tools

Month 5-6: Advanced Implementation
- Program development
- Research design
- Clinical validation methods

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
Module 1: Clinical Foundations
- Free Energy Principle in body awareness
- Predictive processing in movement
- Interoceptive active inference

Module 2: Behavioral Framework
- Belief updating in clinical practice
- Action-perception cycles
- Policy selection in movement patterns

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
- Case study development using active inference models
- Simple computational modeling using clinical data
- Protocol development workshops
- Implementation planning sessions

5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**
- Research design incorporating active inference
- Advanced behavioral modeling
- Integration with existing clinical protocols
- Novel assessment methodologies

6. **PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS**
Clinical Implementation:
- Patient assessment protocols
- Treatment planning frameworks
- Outcome measurement tools
- Integration with posture awareness programs

7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**
- Introduction to key active inference researchers
- Clinical research collaboration opportunities
- Conference presentation opportunities
- Professional network development

8. **ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION**
Milestones:
- Basic theory comprehension (Month 1)
- Protocol development (Month 3)
- Implementation plan (Month 4)
- Research design (Month 6)

9. **RESOURCES AND TOOLS**
Essential Readings:
- "Active Inference" by Thomas Parr et al.
- Selected papers on clinical applications
- Interoception-focused research

Tools:
- Basic computational modeling software
- Clinical assessment tools
- Documentation templates

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

Short-term (1-3 months):
- Master fundamental concepts
- Develop initial clinical protocols
- Begin pilot implementation

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Refine clinical applications
- Develop research protocols
- Create assessment tools

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Full clinical integration
- Research program implementation
- Professional development program creation

This curriculum emphasizes:
- Clinical relevance
- Practical implementation
- Research development
- Professional network expansion

Success Metrics:
- Protocol development
- Clinical implementation
- Research initiation
- Professional network growth

The curriculum is designed to build on Dr. Weiniger's extensive clinical experience while introducing active inference concepts in a clinically relevant way. The focus is on practical implementation and research development, with clear pathways for professional growth and collaboration.
