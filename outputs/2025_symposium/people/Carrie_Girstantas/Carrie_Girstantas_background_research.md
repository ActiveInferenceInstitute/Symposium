## 2. Research Contributions

### Key Publications
Carrie Girstantas does not appear as an author in major academic databases (Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, arXiv). Her name is not listed in peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings, or book chapters in the last 20 years. She is referenced in regulatory and environmental scoping documents as a commenter or contributor, but not as a primary author of research articles [NRC, 2004][5].

### Research Focus Areas and Methodologies
Her contributions are primarily in the context of public comment and regulatory engagement, particularly in environmental and energy policy. She has participated in scoping meetings and provided input on environmental impact assessments, suggesting a focus on systems thinking, policy analysis, and stakeholder engagement. There is no evidence of original research in computational modeling, neuroscience, or education theory.

### Citation Metrics
No citation metrics are available, as she does not have a publication record in academic databases.

### Collaborative Networks
No evidence of collaborative research networks or frequent co-authors in academic literature. She is listed alongside other public commenters in regulatory documents, but not as part of a research team.

### Recent Preprints and Working Papers
No preprints or working papers found in arXiv, bioRxiv, or institutional repositories.
