Academic Background\n\n### Educational History\nThere is no publicly available record of Carrie Girstantas’s formal educational degrees (e.g., bachelor’s, master’s, or doctoral degrees) in major academic databases, institutional directories, or professional profiles. Her ORCID profile does not list educational history, nor do her institutional or professional pages. No university press releases, CVs, or biographical sketches have been found that detail her academic training or graduation years [ORCID, 2025][1].\n\n### Research Areas and Expertise Domains\nCarrie Girstantas is described as working with children of all ages across diverse educational environments in the US, both with and without diagnosis. Her expertise appears to center on educational systems, child development, and systems engineering applied to education and child welfare. She has participated in environmental and regulatory discussions related to energy infrastructure, suggesting interdisciplinary engagement with policy and systems analysis [NRC, 2004][5].\n\n### Current and Past Academic Positions\nCarrie Girstantas is affiliated with the **Department of Systems Engineering at the University of Virginia**. She is listed as a contributor in regulatory and environmental scoping documents, but there is no evidence of a faculty appointment, research scientist title, or teaching role on the University of Virginia’s official faculty or staff directories. Her institutional affiliation is referenced in regulatory and environmental impact contexts, not in academic research or teaching roles [NRC, 2004][5].\n\n### Notable Achievements, Awards, Grants, Honors\nNo public records of awards, grants, or honors have been found in university announcements, professional society databases, or news outlets. There is no evidence of major research funding or recognition in academic or professional circles.\n\n### Academic Profile Pages\n- **ORCID:** [https://orcid.org/0009-0001-7316-6269](https://orcid.org/0009-0001-7316-6269) [1]\n- **Google Scholar:** No active profile found.\n- **ResearchGate:** No active profile found.\n- **University of Virginia Department of Systems Engineering:** No dedicated faculty or staff page found.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Research Contributions\n\n### Key Publications\nCarrie Girstantas does not appear as an author in major academic databases (Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, arXiv). Her name is not listed in peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings, or book chapters in the last 20 years. She is referenced in regulatory and environmental scoping documents as a commenter or contributor, but not as a primary author of research articles [NRC, 2004][5].\n\n### Research Focus Areas and Methodologies\nHer contributions are primarily in the context of public comment and regulatory engagement, particularly in environmental and energy policy. She has participated in scoping meetings and provided input on environmental impact assessments, suggesting a focus on systems thinking, policy analysis, and stakeholder engagement. There is no evidence of original research in computational modeling, neuroscience, or education theory.\n\n### Citation Metrics\nNo citation metrics are available, as she does not have a publication record in academic databases.\n\n### Collaborative Networks\nNo evidence of collaborative research networks or frequent co-authors in academic literature. She is listed alongside other public commenters in regulatory documents, but not as part of a research team.\n\n### Recent Preprints and Working Papers\nNo preprints or working papers found in arXiv, bioRxiv, or institutional repositories.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Professional Experience\n\n### Employment History\nCarrie Girstantas is affiliated with the **Department of Systems Engineering at the University of Virginia**, but there is no evidence of a formal employment history in academic or industry roles. She is not listed in LinkedIn, institutional staff directories, or professional society membership lists. Her involvement appears to be in the context of public engagement and regulatory comment, not as a full-time employee or researcher [NRC, 2004][5].\n\n### Industry Experience and Consulting Work\nNo evidence of industry experience or consulting work found in public records, professional profiles, or news articles.\n\n### Professional Affiliations and Society Memberships\nNo evidence of membership in professional societies or organizations.\n\n### Leadership Roles\nNo evidence of leadership roles in professional organizations.\n\n### Patents, Technical Reports, or Applied Work\nNo patents or technical reports found in USPTO, Google Patents, or institutional repositories. She is referenced in technical and regulatory documents as a commenter, but not as an author or principal investigator.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Active Inference & Related Research\n\n### Direct Connections to Active Inference\nNo evidence of direct involvement in Active Inference research, publications, presentations, or projects. There is no mention of Active Inference, Free Energy Principle, Bayesian inference, or computational neuroscience in her public contributions or affiliations.\n\n### Adjacent Fields\nHer work in systems engineering and regulatory engagement may have methodological overlap with systems thinking and policy modeling, but there is no evidence of engagement with computational neuroscience, Bayesian inference, or mathematical frameworks related to Active Inference.\n\n### Methodological Overlap\nHer participation in environmental and regulatory scoping suggests experience with systems analysis and stakeholder engagement, but not with mathematical modeling, simulation, or computational frameworks.\n\n### Potential Applications\nHer background in systems engineering and child welfare could potentially be applied to educational modeling or policy simulation, but there is no evidence of such work in the context of Active Inference.\n\n### Research Gaps\nThere is no evidence that she is positioned to address research gaps in Active Inference or related fields.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Academic & Professional Network\n\n### Key Collaborators\nNo evidence of collaborative research or frequent co-authors in academic literature.\n\n### Conference Presentations\nNo evidence of conference presentations, workshops, or invited talks in academic or professional contexts.\n\n### Workshop Organization or Participation\nNo evidence of workshop organization or participation.\n\n### Community Engagement\nNo evidence of blog posts, tutorials, or code repositories.\n\n### Social Media Presence\nNo evidence of research-related social media presence.\n\n---\n\n## 6.
