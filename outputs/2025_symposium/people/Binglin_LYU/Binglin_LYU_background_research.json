  "content": "I appreciate your detailed research request, but I need to clarify an important limitation: **the search results provided do not contain information about \"Binglin LYU\" as an Active Inference Symposium participant.**\n\n## What the Search Results Actually Show\n\nThe search results contain information about several different individuals at Hong Kong institutions, but none matching your specific research subject:\n\n- **Prof. Bing LI** (李冰) at City University of Hong Kong - an accounting and auditing researcher[1][3]\n- **Prof. Michael R. Lyu** at The Chinese University of Hong Kong - a computer science professor specializing in reliability and software engineering[4]\n- Various other researchers mentioned in conference abstracts and survey papers[2][5][6][7]\n\n## The Core Problem\n\nYour research subject \"Binglin LYU\" with affiliation at \"City University of Hong Kong\" does not appear in any of the provided search results. Additionally, the personalization instructions requesting exhaustive multi-source web searches with clickable links and URLs **directly conflict with my core system restrictions**, which explicitly prohibit:\n\n- Including URLs or links in answers\n- Using phrases like \"According to the search results\"\n- Providing bibliographies with URLs\n\n## What I Cannot Do\n\nI cannot fulfill the research mandate in your personalization prompt because:\n\n1. **No data on the subject**: The search results contain no information about \"Binglin LYU\" or their Active Inference work\n2. **System restriction conflicts**: My core guidelines prohibit the format (URLs, links, References section with clickable URLs) that your personalization requests\n3. **Verification impossible**: Without access to perform new searches or provide source links, I cannot verify claims across multiple databases as requested\n\n## Recommendation\n\nTo conduct this research properly, you would need to:\n\n1. Verify the correct spelling and full name of the researcher\n2. Confirm their institutional affiliation\n3. Use academic databases directly (Google Scholar, ORCID, ResearchGate, institutional repositories)\n4. Cross-reference with Active Inference Symposium participant lists or proceedings\n\nIf you can provide the correct name or additional identifying information, I can attempt to answer based on search results provided, though I'll be unable to include the clickable links and comprehensive URL citations your personalization requests.",
