I notice that the background information, current applications, learning needs, challenges, and value sought for Fatemeh are not provided. To create a truly personalized and effective curriculum, I'll need these details. However, I can outline a flexible framework that can be adjusted once those details are available.

**PRELIMINARY CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK**

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Initial assessment questionnaire to determine:
  * Mathematical background (statistics, calculus, linear algebra)
  * Programming experience
  * Domain knowledge
  * Prior exposure to Bayesian inference and free energy principles
- Learning style evaluation
- Goals and objectives clarification

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Base Structure (to be refined with participant details):
- Foundation Phase (1-2 months)
  * Basic principles of Active Inference
  * Required mathematical prerequisites
  * Introduction to computational tools
- Development Phase (2-4 months)
  * Core theoretical frameworks
  * Basic implementations
- Application Phase (3-6 months)
  * Domain-specific applications
  * Project development

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
Flexible progression based on background:
- Basic Track:
  * Intuitive understanding of free energy principle
  * Practical applications without heavy math
- Advanced Track:
  * Mathematical foundations
  * Theoretical derivations
  * Advanced computational methods

To provide a more targeted and effective curriculum, I would need to know:
1. Fatemeh's academic/professional background
2. Current understanding of Active Inference
3. Specific domain of application
4. Learning objectives
5. Time availability
6. Technical proficiency

Would you be able to provide these details so I can tailor the curriculum more specifically?
