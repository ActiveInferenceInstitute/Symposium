He is affiliated with Aix-Marseille Université, APHM (Assistance Publique – Hôpitaux de Marseille), INSERM, and the Institut Neurosciences Systèmes (INS, UMR 1106)[1][3][4].\n\nHis verified institutional email is martin.breyton@univ-amu.fr[5].\n\n## Research Focus and Expertise\n\nBreyton's recent research centers on **consciousness quantification and brain complexity**, with particular emphasis on spatiotemporal brain dynamics. His work employs computational neuroscience methodologies to understand consciousness states and their measurement through functional brain repertoires[3][4].\n\nHis research spans:\n- **Computational neuroscience** and brain dynamics modeling\n- **Consciousness assessment** and measurement\n- **Statistical inference** on neural systems\n- **Pharmacological interventions** and their effects on brain dynamics\n- **Deep neural networks** for predicting brain responses\n\n## Key Publications and Research Output\n\n**Recent Major Publication:**\n\nBreyton's most recent significant publication is \"Spatiotemporal brain complexity quantifies consciousness\" published in eLife in 2025 (DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.98920)[4]. This work appears as both a reviewed preprint (2024) and final version (2025), demonstrating peer-reviewed validation of his research methodology. The paper has already accumulated 6 citations despite its recent publication[4].\n\n**Research on Neural Inference:**\n\nBreyton contributed to \"Inference on the Macroscopic Dynamics of Spiking Neurons\" (2024, PubMed ID: 39141813), published in a peer-reviewed venue, which addresses parameter inference on neural networks using deep learning approaches[5]. This work specifically examines how to predict brain dynamics and responses to pharmacological interventions using neural networks.\n\n## Funding and Research Support\n\nBreyton's research has received substantial European and French funding:\n\n- **EU Horizon 2020 Framework Programme** funding through multiple Specific Grant Agreements:\n  - EBRAINS 2.0 Project (No. 101147319)\n  - Virtual Brain Twin Project (No. 101137289)\n  - Project environMENTAL (No. 101057429)\n- **French National Research Agency (Agence Nationale de la Recherche)** grant reference ANR-22-PESN-0012 under the France 2030 program[3][4]\n\n## Collaborative Network\n\nBreyton works within a strong international research consortium, including collaborations with:\n\n- **Viktor Jirsa** (senior researcher, multiple roles in his publications)\n- **Marcello Massimini** (European Research Council grant holder, NEMESIS project)\n- Research groups at Aix-Marseille Université's Institute for Systems Neuroscience\n- INSERM research units\n\n## Online Academic Presence\n\n**Google Scholar Profile:** Available at https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kZ2JWBkAAAAJ&hl=en[1]\n\n**Institutional Affiliation:** Listed on Aix-Marseille Université and APHM (Hôpital Sainte-Marguerite) official pages at https://fr.ap-hm.fr/category/disciplines/pharmacologie-clinique[2]\n\n## Connection to Active Inference and Related Fields\n\nWhile the search results do not explicitly document Breyton's direct participation in Active Inference research or symposia, his work is **highly relevant to Active Inference frameworks** through:\n\n1. **Bayesian inference methodologies** - His neural inference work employs Bayesian estimation and deep neural density estimators, core tools in Active Inference theory\n2. **Predictive modeling** - His focus on predicting brain dynamics and responses to perturbations aligns with predictive processing frameworks central to Active Inference\n3. **Computational neuroscience** - His systems neuroscience approach provides empirical grounding for computational models underlying Active Inference principles\n4. **Consciousness and brain complexity** - His work on quantifying consciousness through functional repertoires relates to information-theoretic approaches in Active Inference research\n\n## Information Limitations\n\nThe available search results do not provide:\n- Complete educational history (undergraduate and graduate degrees)\n- Comprehensive publication list or h-index metrics\n- LinkedIn or ResearchGate profile links\n- ORCID identifier\n- Twitter/X or other social media presence\n- Personal website or blog\n- GitHub repositories or code availability\n- Conference presentation history beyond publications\n- Patents or technical reports\n- Specific awards or honors\n\n## Summary\n\nMartin Breyton is an active clinical pharmacology researcher with demonstrated expertise in computational neuroscience, consciousness quantification, and neural systems modeling. His recent publications show peer-reviewed validation and international collaboration. His methodological approaches in Bayesian inference, predictive modeling, and computational approaches position him as someone whose work is conceptually aligned with Active Inference frameworks, though explicit connections to Active Inference research are not documented in the available search results.\n\nFurther research through direct contact with his institution or searches in Active Inference symposium participant databases would be needed to confirm his specific involvement with Active Inference research communities or events.",
