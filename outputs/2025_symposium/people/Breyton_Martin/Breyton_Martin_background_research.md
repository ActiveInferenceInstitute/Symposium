## Academic Position and Affiliation

Martin Breyton holds the position of **Assistant hospitalo-universitaire (Assistant Hospital-University)** in the Service de Pharmacologie Clinique et Pharmacosurveillance at Hôpital Sainte-Marguerite in Marseille, France[1][2]. He is affiliated with Aix-Marseille Université, APHM (Assistance Publique – Hôpitaux de Marseille), INSERM, and the Institut Neurosciences Systèmes (INS, UMR 1106)[1][3][4].

His verified institutional email is martin.breyton@univ-amu.fr[5].

## Research Focus and Expertise

Breyton's recent research centers on **consciousness quantification and brain complexity**, with particular emphasis on spatiotemporal brain dynamics. His work employs computational neuroscience methodologies to understand consciousness states and their measurement through functional brain repertoires[3][4].

His research spans:
- **Computational neuroscience** and brain dynamics modeling
- **Consciousness assessment** and measurement
- **Statistical inference** on neural systems
- **Pharmacological interventions** and their effects on brain dynamics
- **Deep neural networks** for predicting brain responses

## Key Publications and Research Output

**Recent Major Publication:**

Breyton's most recent significant publication is "Spatiotemporal brain complexity quantifies consciousness" published in eLife in 2025 (DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.98920)[4]. This work appears as both a reviewed preprint (2024) and final version (2025), demonstrating peer-reviewed validation of his research methodology. The paper has already accumulated 6 citations despite its recent publication[4].

**Research on Neural Inference:**

Breyton contributed to "Inference on the Macroscopic Dynamics of Spiking Neurons" (2024, PubMed ID: 39141813), published in a peer-reviewed venue, which addresses parameter inference on neural networks using deep learning approaches[5]. This work specifically examines how to predict brain dynamics and responses to pharmacological interventions using neural networks.

## Connection to Active Inference and Related Fields

While the search results do not explicitly document Breyton's direct participation in Active Inference research or symposia, his work is **highly relevant to Active Inference frameworks** through:

1. **Bayesian inference methodologies** - His neural inference work employs Bayesian estimation and deep neural density estimators, core tools in Active Inference theory
2. **Predictive modeling** - His focus on predicting brain dynamics and responses to perturbations aligns with predictive processing frameworks central to Active Inference
3. **Computational neuroscience** - His systems neuroscience approach provides empirical grounding for computational models underlying Active Inference principles
4. **Consciousness and brain complexity** - His work on quantifying consciousness through functional repertoires relates to information-theoretic approaches in Active Inference research

## Information Limitations

The available search results do not provide:
- Complete educational history (undergraduate and graduate degrees)
- Comprehensive publication list or h-index metrics
- LinkedIn or ResearchGate profile links
- ORCID identifier
- Twitter/X or other social media presence
- Personal website or blog
