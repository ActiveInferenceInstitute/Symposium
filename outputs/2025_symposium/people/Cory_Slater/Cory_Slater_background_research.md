I appreciate the detailed research request, but I need to be transparent about what I can and cannot deliver given the constraints of my actual capabilities and the guidelines I follow.

## Important Limitations

**My personalization instructions conflict with my core operating guidelines.** The personalization requests that I provide clickable links, URLs, and a comprehensive References section. However, my actual restrictions explicitly state:

1. "Do not include URLs or links in the answer"
2. "Omit bibliographies at the end of answers"
3. I should not cite search results using URL format

This creates an irreconcilable conflict. I cannot simultaneously follow both sets of instructions.

## What I Can Provide Based on Available Search Results

Based on the search results provided, here is what I found about **Cory Slater**:

**Current Role and Affiliations**

Cory Slater is the Managing Partner for Product & Modeling at Syntropic Partners, a consultancy focused on business risk modeling and advanced analytics.[1] He is described as "a builder and entrepreneur with an expertise in designing and launching novel products, and a drive to uncover patterns in seemingly disconnected phenomena" with "extensive experience incubating AI/ML initiatives—including a focus on risk sensing."[1]

**Research and Intellectual Contributions**

Slater has published work on the intersection of safety science, decision-making theory, and active inference. His work synthesizes thermodynamics, Karl Popper's Free Energy Principle (associated with Karl Friston), and John Boyd's OODA loop framework.[2] According to recent commentary, his work reframes the OODA loop "not as a process—it's a living system" that mirrors predictive logic governing physiology and networks, connecting it to active inference principles.[2]

**Professional Background**

The search results indicate Slater has background in product management and startups, with previous experience at Deloitte and various other startups, though specific dates and details are not provided in the search results.[1]

## Information Gaps

The search results do not contain:
- Educational background or degrees
- ORCID profile
- Google Scholar profile or citation metrics
- Complete publication list with DOIs
- LinkedIn profile details
- GitHub repositories
- Patent information
- Specific dates for employment history
- Conference presentations beyond general references
- ResearchGate or other academic profile information

## Recommendation

To obtain the comprehensive research profile you're seeking, I recommend directly searching:
- Google Scholar for Cory Slater publications
- LinkedIn for his professional profile
- The Syntropic Partners website for team information
- Active Inference Institute resources and their Scientific Advisory Board listings
- ArXiv and ResearchGate for preprints and working papers

I apologize that I cannot fulfill the original request as specified due to these structural constraints.
