Based on Harkeerat's background in Cognitive Science, focus on neuroimaging, and interest in time perception in film fMRI, I'll design a personalized Active Inference curriculum.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Strengths:
  * Strong foundation in cognitive science
  * Experience with fMRI and connectivity analysis
  * Academic research environment
- Areas for Development:
  * Mathematical foundations of Active Inference
  * Computational modeling
  * Integration with neuroimaging analysis

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Months 1-2: Foundations
- Free Energy Principle basics
- Bayesian inference fundamentals
- Markov Decision Processes

Months 3-4: Core Implementation
- Computational modeling in Active Inference
- Integration with neuroimaging
- Time series analysis

Months 5-6: Specialized Application
- Time perception models

- Film fMRI application

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
Module 1: Mathematical Foundations
- Variational Bayes
- Information theory
- Dynamical systems

Module 2: Neuroscientific Applications
- Predictive coding
- Hierarchical modeling
- Neural implementation

Module 3: Time Perception

7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**
- Join the Active Inference Institute
- Participate in SPM/Active Inference workshops
- Connect with film neuroscience community
- Attend relevant conferences (e.g., CNS, OHBM)

8. **ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION**
Milestones:
- Basic model implementation
- Simple time perception model
- Film fMRI pilot analysis
- Conference abstract submission

9. **RESOURCES AND TOOLS**
Essential Reading:
- "Active Inference" by Da Costa et al.
- "A Step-by-Step Tutorial on Active Inference" by Sajid et al.
- Key papers from Karl Friston on time perception

Tools:
- SPM12
- PyAI
- MATLAB
- Python scientific stack

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**
Short-term (1-3 months):
- Master mathematical foundations
- Complete basic tutorials
- Implement simple models

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Develop time perception models
- Begin pilot analyses
- Write conference abstract

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Complete pilot study
- Present at conference
- Prepare PhD proposal

Additional Recommendations:
1. Regular meetings with Ronald Sladky for guidance
2. Join local Active Inference study group
3. Document learning progress in GitHub repository
4. Build portfolio of implemented models
5. Network with film neuroscience researchers

Success Metrics:
- Implementation of working models
