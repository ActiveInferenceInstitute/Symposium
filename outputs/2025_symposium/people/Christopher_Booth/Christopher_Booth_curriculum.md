10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**
    Short-term (1-3 months):
    - Master mathematical foundations
    - Develop initial prototype
    
    Medium-term (3-6 months):
    - Enhance prototype with curiosity mechanisms
    - Write research paper
    
    Long-term (6-12 months):
    - Submit and present research
    - Contribute to Active Inference community

Recommended Bi-weekly Schedule:
- Week 1: Theory study & implementation
- Week 2: Mentorship session & progress review

Success Metrics:
1. Working prototype demonstrating curiosity-driven learning
2. Completed research paper
3. Active community participation
4. Documented implementation patterns

This curriculum emphasizes practical implementation while building necessary theoretical foundations, leveraging Christopher's engineering background and current role at Neo4j. The bi-monthly cadence provides structure while allowing flexibility for self-paced learning.
