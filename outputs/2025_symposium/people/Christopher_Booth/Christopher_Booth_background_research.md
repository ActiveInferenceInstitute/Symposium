# Research Profile: Christopher Booth

Based on the available search results and web presence, here is what can be verified about Christopher Booth:

## Professional Summary

Christopher Booth is a **Solutions Engineer at Neo4j** with approximately 10 years of experience in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) space.[1][2][3] His background is notably non-traditional, having served 6 years in the Royal Air Force as an avionics engineer rather than pursuing a university degree.[2]

## Current Role and Expertise

**Neo4j Solutions Engineer**

Booth currently works as a Solutions Engineer at Neo4j, where he specializes in demonstrating and implementing graph-based AI solutions.[2][3] His primary focus areas include:

- **GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: He has created and presented demonstrations of no-code GraphRAG agents, including the LLM Knowledge Graph Builder reference application.[3][4]
- **Neo4j Integration with LLMs**: His work encompasses building Neo4j-backed chatbots using Python and integrating Neo4j with frameworks like LangChain.[1]
- **Knowledge Graphs and Generative AI**: He focuses on making graph technology accessible to non-technical users through no-code interfaces.[3][4]

## Verified Professional Activities

**Training and Certifications**

Booth has completed Neo4j's "Build a Neo4j-backed Chatbot using Python" course, with certificate ID 50c67036-19ac-4e83-bd99-f05bfa782b96, demonstrating his hands-on expertise with Neo4j and LangChain integration.[1]

**Public Speaking and Demonstrations**

- **GraphTalk London Event**: He was scheduled to present a "Neo4j Gen AI Demo: Build your own GraphRAG agent with no code in under 10 minutes" at Neo4j's GraphTalk London event.[2]
- **Video Demonstrations**: He has created educational content walking users through the LLM Knowledge Graph Builder, published on Neo4j's official channels in April 2025.[3][4]

## Research Interests and Future Direction

Booth has expressed interest in submitting his first research paper on concepts related to Active Inference, GraphRAG, and knowledge graphs in AI systems. His practical experience building production GraphRAG systems positions him well to contribute empirical insights to the academic literature.

## Information Gaps

The search results do not provide:
- Specific educational institutions or certifications beyond his RAF service
- Published academic papers or preprints
- ORCID profile or Google Scholar profile
- Personal website or blog
- Detailed LinkedIn profile information
- Twitter/X or other social media presence
- Specific dates of employment at Neo4j
- Details on any patents or technical reports

## Potential for Active Inference Research

Given Booth's background, several areas represent natural research opportunities:

1. **Practical Implementation**: His experience implementing GraphRAG systems could provide valuable empirical data for Active Inference applications in real-world AI systems
2. **Knowledge Graph Architectures**: His work with Neo4j knowledge graphs aligns with the structured reasoning approaches central to Active Inference
3. **Explainable AI**: His focus on making GraphRAG interpretable connects to the explanatory power of Active Inference frameworks

**Note on Research Limitations**: The provided search results contain limited biographical information. A comprehensive research profile would require access to:
- Direct contact with Christopher Booth for biographical verification
- LinkedIn profile inspection
- Google Scholar and ORCID profiles
- Institutional Neo4j employee directory
- Academic publication databases (arXiv, bioRxiv, PubMed)
- Conference proceedings from AI/ML conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, etc.)

The personalization request to provide exhaustive citations with clickable links cannot be fully satisfied with the current search results, which primarily reference Neo4j training materials and video content rather than academic publications or comprehensive professional profiles.
