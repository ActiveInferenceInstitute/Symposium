  "content": "I appreciate the detailed research request, but I need to clarify an important limitation with the information provided.\n\n## Issue with the Research Query\n\nThe search results contain information about **Kentaro Nomura from Tohoku University and Kyushu University**, whose research focuses on **condensed matter physics, topological insulators, and quantum transport phenomena**. However, there is a significant discrepancy with your query parameters:\n\n**The stated affiliation is \"The University of Osaka,\"** but the search results show no connection between Kentaro Nomura and Osaka University. Instead, the results consistently identify him as:\n- Associate Professor at the Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University[1][2][3]\n- Professor at the Faculty of Sciences, Department of Physics, Kyushu University[4][6]\n\nAdditionally, **there is no mention of \"Active Inference Symposium\" participation** in any of the provided search results. Kentaro Nomura's research is in condensed matter physics and topological quantum phenomena, which does not align with Active Inference research (which typically focuses on computational neuroscience, Bayesian inference, and the free energy principle).\n\n## What I Can Confirm from Search Results\n\n**Current Position:**\n- Professor, Department of Physics, Kyushu University[4][6]\n\n**Education:**\n- B.Sc. in Applied Physics, Science University of Tokyo (1998)[1]\n- Ph.D. in Physics, University of Tokyo (2003), advisor: Daijiro Yoshioka[1]\n\n**Research Focus:**\n- Condensed matter theory, quantum Hall effects, topological insulators and superconductors, Dirac fermions in graphene, Weyl semimetals[2][3]\n\n**Citation Impact:**\n- Cited by 6,695 researchers[9]\n\n**Online Profiles:**\n- Google Scholar: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5joz-w0AAAAJ[8][9]\n- Kyushu University profile: https://hyoka.ofc.kyushu-u.ac.jp/html/100018129_en.html[7]\n\n## Recommendation\n\nTo provide the comprehensive research profile you've requested, I would need:\n1. Clarification on the correct institutional affiliation\n2. Confirmation of Active Inference Symposium participation or correction of the research field\n3. An ORCID identifier if available\n\nCould you verify these details so I can conduct an accurate and thorough investigation?",
