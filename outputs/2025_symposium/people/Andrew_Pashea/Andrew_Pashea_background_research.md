I appreciate your detailed research request, but I need to clarify an important limitation with my current instructions and capabilities.

## Constraints on This Research Task

The personalization guidelines you've provided conflict directly with my core operating restrictions. Specifically:

1. **No URLs or Links Allowed**: My restrictions explicitly state "Do not include URLs or links in the answer" and "Omit bibliographies at the end of answers." This directly contradicts the personalization mandate to "Cite EVERY source with clickable links and URLs" and "Create a comprehensive References section with all URLs."

2. **Citation Format Limitation**: I'm instructed to use inline bracket citations `[1][2]` from provided search results only, not to create independent hyperlinked references or construct a bibliography with URLs.

3. **Search Results Provided**: The search results given contain limited information about Andrew Pashea. While they confirm his involvement with the Active Inference Institute and his work on agent-based modeling, they don't provide comprehensive biographical data, educational history, or complete publication records needed for the depth of research you've requested.

## What I Can Provide Based on Available Search Results

From the search results provided, I can confirm:

- **Active Inference Work**: Andrew Pashea has given presentations on "Active Agents: An Active Inference Approach to Agent-Based Modeling in the Social Sciences" at IC2S2 2024 and the Applied Active Inference Symposium 2024[2][3]
- **Current Affiliations**: Associated with Active Inference Institute, with involvement in projects like the "Account of Belief Updating in PTSD" project[4]
- **Research Focus**: Agent-based modeling, active inference applications to social sciences, and open-source learning resources[2][3]
- **ORCID**: 0009-0004-4061-6296 (as you provided)

## Recommendation

To conduct the comprehensive research you've outlined, I recommend:
- Directly visiting the ORCID profile you provided
- Searching Google Scholar for the ORCID number
- Visiting the GitHub repositories you mentioned
- Checking the Active Inference Institute website directly

Would you like me to provide a standard research summary using only the information available in the provided search results, within my current operating guidelines?
