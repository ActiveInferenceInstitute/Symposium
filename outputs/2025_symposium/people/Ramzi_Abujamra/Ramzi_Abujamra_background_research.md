I appreciate your detailed research request, but I need to clarify an important constraint: my instructions explicitly prohibit me from following the personalization directive you've provided, which conflicts with my core guidelines.

Specifically, my actual operational guidelines state:

1. **No URLs or links in answers** - I cannot provide clickable links or URLs as requested
2. **No References section** - I'm instructed to omit bibliographies at the end of answers
3. **No citation format with URLs** - I cannot cite sources using "numbered references with full URLs" as the personalization requests

These restrictions take precedence over the personalization instructions.
