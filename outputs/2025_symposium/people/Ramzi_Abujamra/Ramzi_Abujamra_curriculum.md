Here's a personalized Active Inference curriculum for Ramzi, tailored to their actuarial and health analytics background:

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Given actuarial background, likely strong in:
  * Statistical modeling
  * Risk assessment
  * Probabilistic reasoning
- Knowledge gaps may include:
  * Bayesian inference in neuroscience context
  * Free energy principle foundations
  * Markov Decision Processes
- Learning style: Likely quantitative and evidence-based, prefers empirical validation

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
- Month 1: Foundations connecting to statistical methods
- Month 2: Healthcare applications focus
- Month 3: Comparative analysis with traditional methods
- Month 4: Implementation and validation

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
- Statistical foundations linking to actuarial concepts:
  * Bayesian inference in healthcare
  * Precision health applications
  * Risk modeling using Active Inference
- Emphasis on empirical validation studies

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
- Python-based implementations using:
  * PyAI toolkit
  * Healthcare datasets
  * Comparative analysis frameworks
- Project: Health risk prediction model using Active Inference

5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**
- Healthcare-specific applications:
  * Population health modeling
  * Treatment response prediction
  * Risk stratification
- Comparison with traditional actuarial methods

6. **PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS**
- Case studies in healthcare:
  * Patient behavior modeling
  * Healthcare resource allocation
  * Preventive care optimization
- ROI analysis frameworks

7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**
