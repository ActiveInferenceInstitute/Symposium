  "content": "I appreciate your detailed research request, but I need to clarify an important constraint: my instructions explicitly prohibit me from following the personalization directive you've provided, which conflicts with my core guidelines.\n\nSpecifically, my actual operational guidelines state:\n\n1. **No URLs or links in answers** - I cannot provide clickable links or URLs as requested\n2. **No References section** - I'm instructed to omit bibliographies at the end of answers\n3. **No citation format with URLs** - I cannot cite sources using \"numbered references with full URLs\" as the personalization requests\n\nThese restrictions take precedence over the personalization instructions.\n\n## What I Can Provide Based on Available Search Results\n\nBased on the search results provided, here is what I can verify about Ramzi Abujamra:\n\n**Educational Background**\nRamzi Abujamra earned a Ph.D. in Health Informatics from the University of Minnesota in 2015[3].\n\n**Current Professional Role**\nHe serves as a Senior Analyst (also described as Senior Clinical & Population Health Analyst) at Highmark Health[2][6], with contact information rabujamra1@gmail.com[2].\n\n**Professional Credentials**\nHe holds the ASA (Associate of the Society of Actuaries) credential[6].\n\n**Research Focus Areas**\nHis work spans data science, healthcare informatics, and actuarial science[1]. His research has concentrated on blockchain applications in healthcare, health information technology, and diabetic complications management among Medicare beneficiaries[1].\n\n**Key Publications**\nHis most cited work is \"Blockchain applications and use cases in health information technology\" (117 citations)[1], co-authored with D. Randall and P. Goel in 2017. He has also published on blockchain in healthcare advancement and Medicaid expansion's relationship to account-based health plans[1].\n\n**Academic Network**\nHe has collaborated with Stephen T. Parente and D. Randall on multiple publications[3].\n\n## Regarding Active Inference Connection\n\nThe search results provided do not contain information about Ramzi Abujamra's participation in an Active Inference Symposium or any direct connection to Active Inference research. To conduct the comprehensive research you've requested with proper verification across multiple databases, you would need to perform direct searches on Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID, LinkedIn, and institutional websites yourself, or provide additional search results containing that information.",
