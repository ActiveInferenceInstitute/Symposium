I apologize, but I don't have enough information about Alisa Sheinkman's background, current work, or specific interests to provide a detailed analysis for most of the requested categories. Without access to their professional background, research interests, or current involvement with Active Inference, I cannot make specific assessments or recommendations.

To provide an accurate and helpful profile analysis, I would need information about:

1. Their academic/professional background
2. Current research interests
3. Experience with Active Inference
4. Professional goals
5. Specific challenges they're trying to address
6. Areas of expertise
7. Current projects or applications

What I can suggest is a general approach for any symposium participant:

**SYMPOSIUM PARTICIPATION STRATEGY:**
- Attend introductory sessions if new to Active Inference
- Network with other participants
- Take notes on potential collaboration opportunities
- Identify key experts in areas of interest
- Ask questions during Q&A sessions

**LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES:**
- Review fundamental Active Inference literature
- Participate in hands-on workshops
- Engage in discussions with experienced practitioners
- Document questions and insights

Would you be able to provide more specific information about Alisa Sheinkman so I can offer a more detailed and personalized analysis?
