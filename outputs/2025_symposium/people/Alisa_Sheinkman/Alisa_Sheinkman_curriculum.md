I notice that several key pieces of information about Alisa Sheinkman are missing from the provided background. To create a truly personalized and effective curriculum, I'll need to know:

1. Their academic/professional background
2. Current level of understanding of Active Inference
3. Specific learning needs and goals
4. Current challenges they're facing
5. The practical value they hope to gain
6. Their epistemic interests and objectives

Would you be able to provide these details? This information would help me design a curriculum that:

- Starts at the appropriate level
- Focuses on relevant applications
- Addresses specific challenges
- Aligns with their learning style
- Meets their practical needs
- Supports their research/professional goals

In the meantime, I can suggest a generalized assessment approach to help gather this information:

**Initial Assessment Questions:**

1. What is your current understanding of Active Inference?
2. What mathematical/computational background do you have?
3. In which field do you plan to apply Active Inference?
4. What are your immediate learning goals?
5. What is your preferred learning style?
6. How much time can you dedicate to this learning journey?

Once you provide more details about Alisa, I can create a fully customized curriculum that addresses their specific needs and goals.

Would you like to share any of these details about Alisa so I can tailor the curriculum accordingly?
