I appreciate your detailed research request, but I need to clarify an important constraint in how I operate.

While the personalization instructions ask me to provide exhaustive research with clickable links and comprehensive citations, my actual operating guidelines—which take precedence—explicitly restrict me from including URLs or links in my answers and prohibit creating references sections with URLs.

Additionally, the search results provided contain limited information about Alisa Sheinkman. Based on what's available, I can provide you with a comprehensive profile, but I cannot fulfill the specific mandate to provide clickable links throughout or create a references section with URLs.

## Academic Background

Alisa Sheinkman is a recent doctoral graduate from the University of Edinburgh's School of Mathematics and Maxwell Institute for Mathematical Sciences[1][2][3]. She completed her PhD between 2020-2024 under the supervision of Sara Wade[1], focusing on Bayesian deep modeling and probabilistic machine learning. Prior to her doctoral studies, she earned an MS from the University of Cambridge (2019-2020) and an undergraduate degree from the Higher School of Economics in Moscow (2015-2019)[1].

Her research expertise centers on **Bayesian Statistics** and **probabilistic machine learning**, with particular focus on scalable variational inference algorithms, including stochastic and black box variational inference[2].

## Research Contributions

Sheinkman's recent publications include:

- **PhD Dissertation (2025)**: "Probabilistic inference in Bayesian neural networks"[2][7]
- **ECML PKDD 2025**: "Understanding the Trade-offs in Accuracy and Uncertainty Quantification: Architecture and Inference Choices in Bayesian Neural Networks" (with Sara Wade)[2][3]
- **NeurIPS 2025** (accepted, to appear): "SMRS: advocating a unified reporting standard for surrogate models in the artificial intelligence era" (with E. Semenova, T. J. Hitge, S.M. Hall, J. Cockayne)[2]
- **arXiv 2024** (2411.11132): "Variational Bayesian Bow tie Neural Networks with Shrinkage" (with Sara Wade)[2]
- **Journal of the Acoustical Society of America (2023)**: "Deep learning techniques for noise annoyance detection: results from an intensive workshop at the alan turing institute"[2]

Her research addresses **architecture specification of Bayesian neural networks**, **Bayesian model choice**, and **model combination in big data and overparametrized deep models**[2].

## Professional Network

Her primary PhD advisor was Sara Wade at the University of Edinburgh[1]. She has collaborated with researchers including E. Semenova, T. J. Hitge, S.M. Hall, and J. Cockayne on surrogate model standardization work[2].

## Online Presence

Sheinkman maintains a personal research website and is affiliated with the Maxwell Institute at the University of Edinburgh[1][5]. She has an institutional email (s2067879@ed.ac.uk) and maintains profiles on academic platforms[1].

## Limitations

The search results provided do not contain extensive information about:
- Direct involvement with Active Inference or the Active Inference Symposium
- Her specific connections to free energy principle research
- Detailed collaboration networks beyond her PhD advisor
- Social media presence (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, ResearchGate profiles)
- Conference presentations beyond publications
- h-index or detailed citation metrics
- Patents or applied work
- GitHub repositories or code availability

To conduct the truly comprehensive research you've requested with all clickable links and complete references, you would need to directly access academic databases like Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID (using the provided ID: 0009-0002-5926-1929), her personal website, and institutional pages—resources I cannot directly link to in my response format.
