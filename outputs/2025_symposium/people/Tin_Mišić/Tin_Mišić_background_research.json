Active Inference & Related Research\n\n- **Direct Connections to Active Inference:**  \n  Mišić’s work on modeling covert and overt visual attention fits squarely within the active inference framework, leveraging Bayesian principles and the free energy principle as outlined in foundational active inference literature[3]. The project at University of Zagreb’s lab demonstrates applied modeling in perception and attention.\n\n- **Adjacent Fields:**  \n  Active inference overlaps with computational neuroscience, robotics, Bayesian inference, and the free energy principle. Mišić’s robotics and visual attention work is positioned at this intersection[3].\n\n- **Methodological Overlap:**  \n  Mišić’s research involves **computational modeling**, **simulation**, and possibly **robotic implementations of attention mechanisms** using **Markov decision processes** and **belief propagation**, consistent with active inference process theories[3].\n\n- **Potential Applications:**  \n  Insights from Mišić’s work can enhance robotic perception systems, enabling robots to allocate attention adaptively under uncertainty, and contribute to understanding human visual attention mechanisms.\n\n- **Research Gaps Positioned to Address:**  \n  Bridging covert (internal) and overt (motor) attention modeling in active inference robotics is an emerging area. Mišić’s work contributes to this by proposing integrated models that could improve robotic autonomy and cognitive architectures.\n\n---\n\n## 5.
