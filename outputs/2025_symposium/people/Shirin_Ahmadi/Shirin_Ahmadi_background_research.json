  "content": "Based on exhaustive multi-source web research, there is limited publicly available information specifically matching the detailed profile of **Shirin Ahmadi** as an Active Inference Symposium participant with a background in plasma physics transitioning to neuroscience and Active Inference. However, I located several individuals named Shirin Ahmadi/Hajahmadi with related but differing academic profiles. Below is a comprehensive synthesis of the findings, highlighting confirmed data and noting gaps:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Academic Background\n\n- **Dr. Shirin Ahmadi (Technical University of Denmark - DTU)**  \n  - Position: Postdoctoral Researcher, Tropical Pharmacology Lab, DTU[4][1]  \n  - Education:  \n    - BSc and MSc in Biology (Iran)[1]  \n    - PhD in Biotechnology and Biosafety (jointly Eskisehir Osmangazi University, Turkey and DTU)[1]  \n  - Research Areas: Tropical Pharmacology, Biotechnology, Biosafety[1][4]  \n  - No explicit mention of plasma physics, neuroscience, or Active Inference in this profile.  \n  - Profile page: [DTU Research Database](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/shirin-ahmadi)[4]  \n  - No ORCID or Google Scholar profile directly linked on DTU page.  \n\n- **Shirin Hajahmadi (University of Bologna)**  \n  - Position: Research Fellow, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Bologna[2]  \n  - Discipline: Information Processing Systems (ING-INF/05)[2]  \n  - No explicit detailed educational history or focus on plasma physics or Active Inference found.  \n  - CV available at: [Unibo CV](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/shirin.hajahmadi2/cv-en)[2]  \n\n- **Shirin Ahmadi (Educational Sciences)**  \n  - Position: Assistant Professor, Department of Educational Sciences, Hakim[3]  \n  - Google Scholar: 189 citations, but unrelated fields to physics or neuroscience[3]  \n  - Google Scholar profile: [link](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gi3ADLgAAAAJ&hl=en)  \n\n**No direct evidence found of academic background in plasma physics or formal neuroscience degrees for any of these individuals.**  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Research Contributions\n\n- **Dr. Shirin Ahmadi (DTU)**  \n  - Publications focus on biotechnology, biosafety, and tropical pharmacology[4][1]  \n  - Research output includes journal articles and conference posters related to pharmacology and biotech, not Active Inference.  \n  - Citation metrics not publicly detailed.  \n  - No publications explicitly related to Active Inference or Free Energy Principle found in these profiles.  \n\n- **Shirin Hajahmadi (Unibo)**  \n  - Publications potentially in computer science but no clear link to Active Inference or neuroscience visible from CV summary[2]  \n  - No verified DOIs or papers on Active Inference located.  \n\n- **Shirin Ahmadi (Educational Sciences)**  \n  - Google Scholar shows work in education, unrelated to Active Inference or neuroscience[3]  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Professional Experience\n\n- **DTU Dr. Shirin Ahmadi**  \n  - Postdoc researcher at Technical University of Denmark[1][4]  \n  - No industry experience or consulting related to AI or neuroscience found.  \n  - No leadership roles or patents publicly listed.  \n\n- **Shirin Hajahmadi (Unibo)**  \n  - Research fellow; no further employment history available publicly[2]  \n\n- **Assistant Professor Ahmadi (Hakim)**  \n  - Academic teaching and research in educational sciences[3]  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Active Inference & Related Research\n\n- No direct publications, presentations, or projects by any of the above-listed Shirin Ahmadis directly linked to **Active Inference**, **Free Energy Principle**, or **Bayesian Inference**.  \n- No methodological overlaps or explicit references to these frameworks in their publicly accessible work.  \n- No evidence of involvement in computational neuroscience or related fields based on available data.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Academic & Professional Network\n\n- No clear information on collaborators linked to Active Inference community or Karl Friston’s group.  \n- No conference talks or workshop participations publicly indexed tied to Active Inference or related fields under these profiles.  \n- No public community engagement such as blogs, tutorials, or code repositories related to Active Inference found.  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Online Presence & Resources\n\n| Resource Type                    | Available Links                                   | Notes                          |\n|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Personal website/research page   | None found matching Active Inference profile    |                              |\n| Google Scholar                  | [Shirin Ahmadi - Educational Sciences](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gi3ADLgAAAAJ&hl=en) | Unrelated field               |\n| ResearchGate                   | No verified profile for stated research area    |                              |\n| LinkedIn                       | No verified LinkedIn for plasma physics to AI shift | Possibly private or absent   |\n| GitHub/Code Repos              | None found                                       |                              |\n| Twitter/X                      | None identified                                  |                              |\n| ORCID                         | None identified                                  |                              |\n| Institutional profile          | [DTU Research Database (Pharmacology)](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/shirin-ahmadi) | No neuroscience link          |\n\n---\n\n### 7. Future Potential & Opportunities\n\n- Since the self-reported profile mentions a **shift from plasma physics to neuroscience and Active Inference**, but no corresponding public academic footprint was found, this may indicate either an emerging researcher with limited publications or a different individual not yet publicly documented in these areas.  \n- The potential for applying Active Inference to emotion modeling, empathetic AI, and interoceptive systems aligns with current interdisciplinary trends but no verifiable outputs or collaborations are evident yet.  \n- Opportunities would include establishing a stronger online presence with publications or preprints in computational neuroscience or AI forums, collaboration with established Active Inference researchers, and participation in related conferences.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- **No verifiable public academic or professional footprint was found that fully matches the detailed self-reported background of Shirin Ahmadi as a plasma physics-trained researcher transitioning to Active Inference and neuroscience.**  \n- The closest matches are researchers named Shirin Ahmadi or Hajahmadi working in biology, pharmacology, biotechnology, or educational sciences with no direct connection to Active Inference.  \n- If this participant is an early-career researcher or involved under a different name or affiliation, their profile is not yet publicly accessible through standard academic and professional databases as of Nov 2025.  \n- Further information may require direct contact through symposium organizers or personal outreach.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n1.
