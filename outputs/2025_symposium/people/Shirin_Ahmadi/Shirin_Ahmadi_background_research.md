Based on exhaustive multi-source web research, there is limited publicly available information specifically matching the detailed profile of **Shirin Ahmadi** as an Active Inference Symposium participant with a background in plasma physics transitioning to neuroscience and Active Inference. However, I located several individuals named Shirin Ahmadi/Hajahmadi with related but differing academic profiles. Below is a comprehensive synthesis of the findings, highlighting confirmed data and noting gaps:

---

---

### 4. Active Inference & Related Research

- No direct publications, presentations, or projects by any of the above-listed Shirin Ahmadis directly linked to **Active Inference**, **Free Energy Principle**, or **Bayesian Inference**.  
- No methodological overlaps or explicit references to these frameworks in their publicly accessible work.  
- No evidence of involvement in computational neuroscience or related fields based on available data.  

---

### 5. Academic & Professional Network

- No clear information on collaborators linked to Active Inference community or Karl Friston’s group.  
- No conference talks or workshop participations publicly indexed tied to Active Inference or related fields under these profiles.  
- No public community engagement such as blogs, tutorials, or code repositories related to Active Inference found.

### 7. Future Potential & Opportunities

- Since the self-reported profile mentions a **shift from plasma physics to neuroscience and Active Inference**, but no corresponding public academic footprint was found, this may indicate either an emerging researcher with limited publications or a different individual not yet publicly documented in these areas.  
- The potential for applying Active Inference to emotion modeling, empathetic AI, and interoceptive systems aligns with current interdisciplinary trends but no verifiable outputs or collaborations are evident yet.  
- Opportunities would include establishing a stronger online presence with publications or preprints in computational neuroscience or AI forums, collaboration with established Active Inference researchers, and participation in related conferences.

---

### Summary

- **No verifiable public academic or professional footprint was found that fully matches the detailed self-reported background of Shirin Ahmadi as a plasma physics-trained researcher transitioning to Active Inference and neuroscience.**  
- The closest matches are researchers named Shirin Ahmadi or Hajahmadi working in biology, pharmacology, biotechnology, or educational sciences with no direct connection to Active Inference.  
- If this participant is an early-career researcher or involved under a different name or affiliation, their profile is not yet publicly accessible through standard academic and professional databases as of Nov 2025.  
- Further information may require direct contact through symposium organizers or personal outreach.
