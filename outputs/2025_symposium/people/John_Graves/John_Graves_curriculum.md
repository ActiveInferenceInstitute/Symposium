I notice that several key pieces of information about John Graves are missing from the profile, which would help create a more targeted curriculum. However, I'll design a curriculum focused on his stated need for working Python examples with open-source implementation, while making some reasonable assumptions that can be adjusted based on additional information.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
Recommended Initial Assessment:
- Complete a diagnostic quiz on probability theory and Bayesian inference
- Review of basic Python programming proficiency
- Self-assessment of familiarity with core Active Inference concepts
- Survey of specific use cases and applications of interest

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Foundation (Weeks 1-4):
- Python fundamentals for Active Inference
- Probability theory and Bayesian basics
- Introduction to Free Energy Principle
- Basic generative models

Implementation Phase (Weeks 5-12):
- Working with pymdp library
- Building simple Active Inference agents
- Implementing basic decision-making models
- Practical examples with shared code

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
Sequential Learning Units:
```python
modules = {
    'basics': ['Markov Decision Processes', 'Free Energy Principle'],
    'intermediate': ['Variational Inference', 'Message Passing'],
    'advanced': ['Precision Engineering', 'Hierarchical Models']
}
```

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
Practical Projects:
- Building a simple Active Inference agent in Python
- Implementing the Mountain Car example
- Creating a custom environment
- Working with the pymdp toolkit

5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**
Specialized Focus:
- Deep Active Inference
- Multi-agent systems
- Hierarchical Active Inference
- Custom implementation patterns

6. **PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS**
Implementation Focus:
```python
application_areas = {
    'robotics': ['Navigation', 'Control'],
    'decision_making': ['Planning', 'Learning'],
    'perception': ['Pattern Recognition', 'Sensor Integration']
}
```

7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**
Engagement Channels:
- GitHub repository for code sharing
- Active Inference Institute collaboration
- Online forums and discussion groups
- Code review sessions

8. **ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION**
Milestone Projects:
- Basic agent implementation
- Custom environment creation
- Complex decision-making system
- Portfolio of working examples

9. **RESOURCES AND TOOLS**
Essential Resources:
```python
resources = {
    'code': ['pymdp', 'gym-ai', 'pytorch'],
    'papers': ['Tutorial Papers', 'Implementation Examples'],
    'communities': ['GitHub', 'Discord', 'Academic Forums']
}
```

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

Short-term (1-3 months):
- Master basic Python implementation
- Complete fundamental Active Inference examples
- Build simple working agents

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Develop custom environments
- Implement complex decision-making systems
- Contribute to open-source projects

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Create novel implementations
- Share working examples
- Build practical applications

Success Metrics:
```python
metrics = {
    'code_completion': ['Working Examples', 'GitHub Projects'],
    'understanding': ['Implementation Ability', 'Problem Solving'],
    'contribution': ['Shared Code', 'Community Engagement']
}
```

To make this curriculum more specific to John's needs, please provide:
1. His current level of Python expertise
2. Specific application areas of interest
3. Prior experience with Active Inference
4. Time availability for learning
5. Preferred learning style
6. Specific challenges he's facing

This will allow for further customization of the curriculum to better match his needs and goals.
