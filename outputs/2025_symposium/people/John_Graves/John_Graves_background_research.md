### 1. Academic Background

- **Educational History:**  
  No direct sources explicitly detail John Graves’s degrees or alma mater tied to ORCID 0009-0003-7095-8687. The ORCID provided does not resolve in public databases, nor do common academic profiles under that ORCID show full educational history. This gap suggests limited publicly available data, or the individual may primarily operate outside traditional academic institutions.

- **Research Areas and Expertise:**  
  John Graves is active in **health data science**, **machine learning applied to health research**, and **decision modeling in healthcare**. This is evidenced by a 2021 publication on decision modeling approaches for health (Graves et al., 2021)[4] and involvement in machine learning case studies for health research[1]. These suggest expertise in computational methods, data-driven health decision science, and statistical modeling.

- **Academic Positions:**  
  No direct institutional academic profile or faculty page was found for John Graves at Data Science Academy or other universities. The Data Science Academy affiliation appears more professional or training-oriented rather than a traditional academic position.

- **Notable Achievements, Awards, Grants:**  
  No explicit awards or grants were publicly listed for John Graves in accessible databases or announcements. This may be due to the individual's professional focus or relatively recent emergence.

- **Academic Profiles:**  
  - ORCID profile for 0009-0003-7095-8687 could not be found publicly.  
  - No Google Scholar or ResearchGate profiles matching this precise identity were found.  
  - Publications linked to the name John Graves in health data science exist but cannot be conclusively connected without further identifiers.

### 2. Research Contributions

- **Key Publications:**  
  - *Comparison of Decision Modeling Approaches for Health* (2021), co-authored by John Graves et al. in Medical Decision Making [DOI: 10.1177/0272989X21995805][4]. This paper compares modeling approaches for health decisions, indicating methodological expertise.  
  - Contributions to case studies on machine learning with health data involving complex data types like genomic data (2025)[1].

- **Research Focus and Methodologies:**  
  Focus on **machine learning in health research**, **decision-making models**, and **handling complex health data types** such as genomic and survey data[1][4]. Methodologies include statistical modeling, computational workflows for preprocessing diverse health datasets, and simulation-based decision analysis.

- **Citation Metrics:**  
  Due to lack of a confirmed Google Scholar profile, h-index and citation counts are not available. The 2021 decision modeling paper has been cited in the health informatics community but exact metrics are not verifiable at this time.

- **Collaborative Networks:**  
  Co-authors include Shawn Garbett, Zilu Zhou, Jonathan S. Schildcrout among others[4]. These collaborators are active in health decision science and biostatistics, indicating John Graves works within interdisciplinary health data science teams.

- **Recent Preprints and Working Papers:**  
  No preprints or arXiv/bioRxiv papers connected to John Graves were identified.
