Based on the limited information provided in the profile, I'll provide an analysis while noting areas where more information would be beneficial for a complete assessment.

1. **EXPERTISE ASSESSMENT**
- Current knowledge level appears to be early-stage/exploratory based on the learning needs
- Technical background includes Python programming capabilities
- Other aspects of expertise cannot be determined from provided information

2. **LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES**
- Primary identified need: Working examples in Python
- Recommended learning path:
  * Start with practical Python implementations of basic Active Inference models
  * Focus on open-source resources and examples
  * Build from basic to more complex implementations
- Should explore existing Python frameworks for Active Inference (e.g., PyAI, pymdp)

3. **RESEARCH INTERESTS ALIGNMENT**
- Interest in practical implementation suggested by focus on Python examples
- More information needed about specific research interests
- Potential focus on computational aspects of Active Inference
- Could contribute to developing open-source implementations

4. **COLLABORATION POTENTIAL**
- Could collaborate with others interested in Python implementations
- May contribute to open-source Active Inference projects
- Would benefit from connecting with experienced practitioners
- Could participate in code-sharing and development initiatives

5. **SYMPOSIUM PARTICIPATION STRATEGY**
Priority focus areas:
- Technical workshops featuring Python implementations
- Hands-on coding sessions
- Tutorials on practical applications
- Networking with practitioners who have developed working implementations

6. **DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP**
Short-term:
- Acquire basic Active Inference implementation skills
- Develop working knowledge of Python frameworks

Medium-term:
- Build practical implementation portfolio
- Contribute to open-source projects

Long-term:
- Create and share own implementations
- Potentially develop new tools or frameworks

7. **ACTIVE INFERENCE INTEGRATION**
- Focus on computational aspects suggests technical integration pathway
- Could contribute to making Active Inference more accessible through code
- Potential to bridge theory-practice gap through implementations
- May help develop practical applications

**Limitations & Recommendations:**
1. More information needed about:
   - Professional background
   - Current work context
   - Specific research interests
   - Prior exposure to Active Inference

2. Suggested next steps:
   - Clarify specific areas of interest within Active Inference
   - Identify concrete application goals
   - Connect with Python-focused Active Inference community
   - Begin with basic implementations and gradually increase complexity

3. Additional considerations:
   - Consider joining relevant coding communities
   - Participate in code review sessions
   - Document and share learning progress
   - Seek mentorship from experienced practitioners

This analysis is based on limited information and should be refined as more details become available about John Graves's background and specific interests.
