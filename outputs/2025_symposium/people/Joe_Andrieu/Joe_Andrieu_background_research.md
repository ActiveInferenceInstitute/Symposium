## 4. Active Inference & Related Research

### Direct Connections to Active Inference

No direct publications, presentations, or projects by Joe Andrieu on **Active Inference** were found in academic databases or conference proceedings. His work is primarily in **decentralized identity** and **privacy**, with no explicit overlap with **Active Inference** or the **free energy principle**.

### Adjacent Fields

Joe Andrieu’s expertise in **decentralized systems**, **privacy**, and **requirements engineering** could be relevant to **Active Inference** in the context of **modeling human behavior** and **privacy-preserving inference**. However, there is no evidence of direct engagement with **Bayesian inference**, **computational neuroscience**, or **Active Inference** frameworks.

### Methodological Overlap

His work on **functional privacy** and **requirements engineering** could inform the development of **privacy-preserving Active Inference models**, but this is speculative and not supported by published research.
