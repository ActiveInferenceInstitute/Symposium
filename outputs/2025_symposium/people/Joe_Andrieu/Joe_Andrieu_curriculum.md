I notice that several key pieces of information about Joe's background, learning needs, challenges, and value sought are missing. To create a truly personalized curriculum, I'll need more details about:

1. Professional/academic background
2. Specific learning needs and goals
3. Current challenges with Active Inference
4. What practical applications they're interested in
5. What kind of theoretical understanding they seek

However, I can provide an initial framework that can be refined once more information is available.

**INITIAL ASSESSMENT (Based on "Just getting started"):**

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Entry-level understanding of Active Inference
- Need to establish foundational concepts
- Recommend initial self-assessment questionnaire to determine:
  * Mathematical background
  * Programming experience
  * Domain expertise
  * Learning preferences

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Initial Recommendation:
- Start with conceptual understanding before mathematical details
- Focus on intuitive explanations and visual learning
- Progressive complexity approach
- Regular practical exercises

Would you be able to provide more information about Joe's:
1. Professional background?
2. Mathematical/technical expertise?
3. Specific areas of interest in Active Inference?
4. Preferred learning style?
5. Time availability for learning?

This would allow me to create a much more targeted and effective curriculum that aligns with Joe's specific needs and goals.

Would you like me to:
1. Continue with a general curriculum designed for beginners?
2. Wait for more specific information to create a truly personalized plan?
3. Focus on specific aspects of the curriculum that are most relevant to Joe's current "just getting started" stage?

Please let me know which direction would be most helpful, and I'll be happy to provide more detailed recommendations accordingly.
