## 4. Active Inference & Related Research

### Direct Connections to Active Inference

Barumerli has not published directly on Active Inference or the Free Energy Principle. However, his work on **Bayesian inference in auditory perception** and **computational modeling of spatial hearing** is methodologically adjacent to Active Inference frameworks [12, 13].

### Adjacent Fields

- **Bayesian Inference:** Central to his modeling of auditory perception and spatial attention [12, 13]
- **Computational Neuroscience:** His models of auditory scene analysis and spatial hearing align with computational approaches in neuroscience 
- **Free Energy Principle:** While not explicitly cited, his Bayesian models are compatible with Free Energy-based frameworks for perception and action 

### Methodological Overlap

- **Bayesian modeling** of perception and attention [12, 13]
- **Computational simulation** of auditory environments 
- **Mathematical frameworks** for spatial hearing and attention 

### Potential Applications to Active Inference

Barumerli’s expertise in **Bayesian modeling of auditory perception** and **spatial attention** could be applied to Active Inference models of auditory scene analysis, action planning, and affective states in immersive environments [11, 12].

### Research Gaps

- **Integration of Active Inference** into models of spatial hearing and auditory scene analysis
- **Application of Free Energy Principle** to auditory perception in complex environments
- **Modeling affective states** in auditory peripersonal space using Active Inference frameworks
