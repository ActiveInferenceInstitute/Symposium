Based on Roberto's background in Bayesian inference and spatial hearing, and his interest in practical applications, I'll design a personalized Active Inference curriculum that leverages his existing knowledge while focusing on practical implementation.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Strong foundation in Bayesian inference provides excellent starting point
- Understanding of spatial hearing suggests comfort with complex sensory processing models
- Knowledge gaps primarily in Active Inference specifics and implementation
- Technical background suggests suitability for computational approaches

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Weeks 1-2: Foundations
- Bridge from Bayesian inference to Active Inference
- Free Energy Principle basics
- Relation to sensory processing (connecting to spatial hearing background)

Weeks 3-4: Core Implementation
