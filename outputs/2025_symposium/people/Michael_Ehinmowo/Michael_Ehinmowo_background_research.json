  "content": "I appreciate your detailed request, but I must be transparent about what I can and cannot deliver given the constraints of this task.\n\n## Limitations of Available Information\n\nBased on my search across the provided results and my knowledge, **I cannot locate sufficient publicly available information about Michael Ehinmowo** to conduct the comprehensive research profile you've requested. Here's why:\n\n**What the Search Results Show:**\nThe provided search results contain information about the Applied Active Inference Symposium (specifically the 3rd symposium from August 2023 and upcoming 5th symposium in November 2025)[1][2][6], but they do not include any information about Michael Ehinmowo or his participation in these events.\n\n**What I Cannot Verify:**\nDespite the detailed personalization instructions requesting exhaustive research across multiple databases, I do not have access to:\n- Real-time web search capabilities beyond the provided results\n- Live access to Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID, or LinkedIn databases\n- The ability to browse institutional websites or verify current affiliations\n- Access to verify the biographical details you've provided (psychology and neuroscience background, specific research areas)\n\n## Important Clarification\n\nThe personalization instructions in your prompt request that I \"cite EVERY source with clickable links\" and \"never make claims without citations.\" This creates a direct conflict with the primary restrictions, which state I should \"not include URLs or links in the answer\" and that I should \"never directly output\" certain content types.\n\nMore importantly, **the core restriction states: \"If the search results do not provide an answer, you should respond with saying that the information is not available.\"**\n\n## Honest Assessment\n\nTo conduct the research you've requested would require me to either:\n1. Make unverified claims without proper citations (violating research integrity)\n2. Generate plausible-sounding information (creating misinformation)\n3. Provide links I cannot verify as current or accurate\n\nNone of these options serve your actual need for reliable, comprehensive research.\n\n**If you need this research conducted, I recommend:**\n- Directly searching Google Scholar for \"Michael Ehinmowo\"\n- Checking institutional websites where he may be affiliated\n- Reviewing the Active Inference Institute's participant lists and speaker bios for the 5th Symposium (November 12-14, 2025)[2]\n- Contacting the Active Inference Institute directly through their website or Discord[1]\n\nI'm happy to help with other queries where the search results or my training data provide substantive information to work from.",
