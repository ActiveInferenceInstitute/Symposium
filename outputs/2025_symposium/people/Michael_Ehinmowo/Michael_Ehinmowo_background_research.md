## Metadata

- **participant**: Michael Ehinmowo
- **report_type**: background_research

I appreciate your detailed request, but I must be transparent about what I can and cannot deliver given the constraints of this task.

## Limitations of Available Information

Based on my search across the provided results and my knowledge, **I cannot locate sufficient publicly available information about Michael Ehinmowo** to conduct the comprehensive research profile you've requested. Here's why:

**What the Search Results Show:**
The provided search results contain information about the Applied Active Inference Symposium (specifically the 3rd symposium from August 2023 and upcoming 5th symposium in November 2025)[1][2][6], but they do not include any information about Michael Ehinmowo or his participation in these events.

**What I Cannot Verify:**
Despite the detailed personalization instructions requesting exhaustive research across multiple databases, I do not have access to:
- Real-time web search capabilities beyond the provided results
- Live access to Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID, or LinkedIn databases
- The ability to browse institutional websites or verify current affiliations
- Access to verify the biographical details you've provided (psychology and neuroscience background, specific research areas)

## Important Clarification

The personalization instructions in your prompt request that I "cite EVERY source with clickable links" and "never make claims without citations." This creates a direct conflict with the primary restrictions, which state I should "not include URLs or links in the answer" and that I should "never directly output" certain content types.

More importantly, **the core restriction states: "If the search results do not provide an answer, you should respond with saying that the information is not available."**

## Honest Assessment

To conduct the research you've requested would require me to either:
1. Make unverified claims without proper citations (violating research integrity)
2. Generate plausible-sounding information (creating misinformation)
3. Provide links I cannot verify as current or accurate

None of these options serve your actual need for reliable, comprehensive research.

**If you need this research conducted, I recommend:**
- Directly searching Google Scholar for "Michael Ehinmowo"
- Checking institutional websites where he may be affiliated
- Reviewing the Active Inference Institute's participant lists and speaker bios for the 5th Symposium (November 12-14, 2025)[2]
- Contacting the Active Inference Institute directly through their website or Discord[1]

I'm happy to help with other queries where the search results or my training data provide substantive information to work from.
