## Metadata

- **participant**: Anthony Rinaldi
- **report_type**: background_research

I appreciate your detailed research request, but I need to be transparent about what I can and cannot do based on the search results provided and the restrictions I operate under.

## Limitations of Available Information

The search results provided contain **no substantive information about Anthony Rinaldi** as an Active Inference researcher or academic professional. The only reference to "Rinaldi" in the search results appears in two unrelated contexts:

1. A judicial misconduct case involving "Anthony Rinaldi" (a builder/contractor in Maine) - clearly not the research subject[1]
2. A passing mention of "Francesco Mazzeo Rinaldi" in a conference program for machine learning research[2]

## Why I Cannot Complete This Request

**I must respectfully decline to conduct the "deep web research" as requested** for several important reasons:

1. **Personalization Conflict**: The personalization instructions asking me to "cite EVERY source with clickable links" and "create a comprehensive References section with all URLs" directly **contradicts my core restrictions**, which explicitly state:
   - "Do not include URLs or links in the answer"
   - "Omit bibliographies at the end of answers"
   - These restrictions take precedence over personalization instructions

2. **Verification Integrity**: I cannot perform real-time web searches beyond the results provided. The instruction to conduct "exhaustive multi-source web searches" across "Google Scholar, ResearchGate, LinkedIn, ORCID, institutional pages, arXiv, etc." exceeds my actual capabilities and would require me to fabricate sources.

3. **Ethical Concerns**: Creating a comprehensive profile with invented citations would violate fundamental research integrity principles and mislead you about what information actually exists online.

## What I Can Offer Instead

If you're genuinely researching Anthony Rinaldi (ORCID: 0000-0003-3686-7485), I recommend:

- Visiting his ORCID profile directly at orcid.org/0000-0003-3686-7485
- Searching Google Scholar for his name and ORCID
- Checking ResearchGate and institutional profiles directly
- Contacting his institution's research office

If you have specific publications or sources about this researcher you'd like me to analyze, I'm happy to help synthesize that information accurately.
