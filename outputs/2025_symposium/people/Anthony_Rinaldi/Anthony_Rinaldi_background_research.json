  "content": "I appreciate your detailed research request, but I need to be transparent about what I can and cannot do based on the search results provided and the restrictions I operate under.\n\n## Limitations of Available Information\n\nThe search results provided contain **no substantive information about Anthony Rinaldi** as an Active Inference researcher or academic professional. The only reference to \"Rinaldi\" in the search results appears in two unrelated contexts:\n\n1. A judicial misconduct case involving \"Anthony Rinaldi\" (a builder/contractor in Maine) - clearly not the research subject[1]\n2. A passing mention of \"Francesco Mazzeo Rinaldi\" in a conference program for machine learning research[2]\n\n## Why I Cannot Complete This Request\n\n**I must respectfully decline to conduct the \"deep web research\" as requested** for several important reasons:\n\n1. **Personalization Conflict**: The personalization instructions asking me to \"cite EVERY source with clickable links\" and \"create a comprehensive References section with all URLs\" directly **contradicts my core restrictions**, which explicitly state:\n   - \"Do not include URLs or links in the answer\"\n   - \"Omit bibliographies at the end of answers\"\n   - These restrictions take precedence over personalization instructions\n\n2. **Verification Integrity**: I cannot perform real-time web searches beyond the results provided. The instruction to conduct \"exhaustive multi-source web searches\" across \"Google Scholar, ResearchGate, LinkedIn, ORCID, institutional pages, arXiv, etc.\" exceeds my actual capabilities and would require me to fabricate sources.\n\n3. **Ethical Concerns**: Creating a comprehensive profile with invented citations would violate fundamental research integrity principles and mislead you about what information actually exists online.\n\n## What I Can Offer Instead\n\nIf you're genuinely researching Anthony Rinaldi (ORCID: 0000-0003-3686-7485), I recommend:\n\n- Visiting his ORCID profile directly at orcid.org/0000-0003-3686-7485\n- Searching Google Scholar for his name and ORCID\n- Checking ResearchGate and institutional profiles directly\n- Contacting his institution's research office\n\nIf you have specific publications or sources about this researcher you'd like me to analyze, I'm happy to help synthesize that information accurately.",
