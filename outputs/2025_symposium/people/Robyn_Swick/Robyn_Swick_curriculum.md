Based on the information provided, I'll design a curriculum focused on helping Robyn develop expertise in Active Inference with a specific focus on educational marketing to developers. Given her work with David Kam on decentralizing Verses models, I'll emphasize practical applications and developer-oriented content.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Working knowledge of Active Inference implementation in decentralized systems
- Exposure to practical applications through Verses work
- Need to develop educational marketing skills for technical audiences
- Need to bridge theoretical foundations with developer-friendly explanations

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
- Focus on developer education and technical marketing
- Emphasis on practical implementations and code examples
- Progressive development of teaching materials
- Timeline: 6 months intensive learning with ongoing development

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
- Active Inference fundamentals from a developer perspective
- Free Energy Principle simplified for technical audiences
- Markov Decision Processes in practical terms
- Implementation patterns and best practices

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
- Development of code tutorials and examples
- Creation of interactive learning materials
- Building developer documentation
- Creating educational repositories and notebooks

5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**
- Decentralized Active Inference implementations
- Scaling Active Inference systems
- Multi-agent systems and collective intelligence
- Integration with existing development frameworks

6. **PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS**
- Developer workshop design and delivery
- Creating technical documentation
- Building learning pathways for developers
- Case studies from Verses implementation

7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**
- Engagement with developer communities
- Building an Active Inference developer network
- Creating educational content partnerships
- Organizing developer meetups and workshops

8. **ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION**
- Development of educational materials portfolio
- Creation of developer-friendly tutorials
- Workshop delivery assessment
- Community engagement metrics

9. **RESOURCES AND TOOLS**
- GitHub repositories for educational content
- Interactive notebooks and tutorials
- Developer documentation templates
- Community building platforms

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**
Short-term (1-3 months):
- Develop foundational tutorial series
- Create basic developer documentation
- Build initial workshop structure

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Launch developer community platform
- Deliver first workshop series
- Create advanced tutorial content

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Scale educational program
- Establish certification program
- Build comprehensive learning platform

This curriculum emphasizes creating educational content that resonates with developers while maintaining technical accuracy and practical applicability. The focus is on building bridges between theoretical Active Inference concepts and practical implementation needs.

Note: This is an initial framework that can be refined based on more specific information about Robyn's background, current challenges, and specific pragmatic/epistemic value sought.
