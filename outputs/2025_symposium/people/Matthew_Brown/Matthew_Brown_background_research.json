  "content": "I appreciate the detailed research request, but I need to clarify an important limitation: the personalization instructions in your prompt conflict with the core restrictions I'm bound by, and the restrictions take precedence.\n\nSpecifically, I cannot:\n\n1. **Provide clickable URLs or links** - This is explicitly restricted in my guidelines (Restriction #1)\n2. **Create a References section with URLs** - This violates Restriction #2 (omit bibliographies)\n3. **Cite sources with clickable links throughout** - The personalization requests this, but my restrictions forbid it\n\n## What I Can Provide Based on Available Search Results\n\nBased on the search results provided, here is what I can verify about Matthew Brown:\n\n**Educational Background**\n\nMatthew Brown holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Engineering from MIT, completed in 2002[1]. He also holds a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania[2][4].\n\n**Professional Experience**\n\nMatthew Brown is the Founder and CEO of ThoughtForge, an AI company specializing in robotics and automation[1][2][4]. He has over 24 years of experience in artificial intelligence[2][3]. His career includes:\n\n- Principal Software Engineer at Microsoft, focusing on AI and research[1]\n- Lead AI Engineer at Bonsai AI (acquired by Microsoft in 2018), where he pioneered early applications of Deep Reinforcement Learning[2][3][4]\n- AI systems development for video game franchises including Halo, Bioshock, and Splinter Cell[2][3][4]\n- Work on the Aegis Combat System at Lockheed Martin[2][3]\n- Various senior engineering roles at 343 Industries, 2K, KIXEYE, Ubisoft Toronto, Beyond Games, and Electronic Arts[1]\n\n**Active Inference & Related Work**\n\nMatthew Brown serves as a guest lecturer and board member at the Active Institute, focusing on Active Inference and its applications in Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence[2][4].\n\n**Current Research Focus**\n\nThoughtForge is working on an ARM Institute-funded project called \"Adaptive Robotic Insertion of Automotive Parts using Multi-modal Artificial Intelligence,\" aimed at automating insertion of soft/deformable parts in automotive, aerospace, and electronic manufacturing[2].\n\n**Limitation**\n\nThe search results do not contain comprehensive information about publications, citations metrics, ORCID profile details, or extensive recent conference presentations. To conduct the exhaustive research you've requested with full citations and links, you would need to directly access Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID (0000-0002-7552-0989), and institutional databases—resources I cannot provide clickable links to per my operational guidelines.",
