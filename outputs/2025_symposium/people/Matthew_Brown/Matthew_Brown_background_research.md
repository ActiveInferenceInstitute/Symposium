I appreciate the detailed research request, but I need to clarify an important limitation: the personalization instructions in your prompt conflict with the core restrictions I'm bound by, and the restrictions take precedence.

Specifically, I cannot:

1. **Provide clickable URLs or links** - This is explicitly restricted in my guidelines (Restriction #1)
2. **Create a References section with URLs** - This violates Restriction #2 (omit bibliographies)
3. **Cite sources with clickable links throughout** - The personalization requests this, but my restrictions forbid it

**Limitation**

The search results do not contain comprehensive information about publications, citations metrics, ORCID profile details, or extensive recent conference presentations. To conduct the exhaustive research you've requested with full citations and links, you would need to directly access Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID (0000-0002-7552-0989), and institutional databases—resources I cannot provide clickable links to per my operational guidelines.
