I apologize, but I notice that the profile information for Matthew Brown appears to be empty - all the sections (**Background & Prior Works**, **Pragmatic Value Sought**, etc.) contain no data. Without this underlying information about Matthew Brown, I cannot provide a meaningful analysis of his profile.

To provide a comprehensive analysis across the 7 requested dimensions (Expertise Assessment, Learning Opportunities, Research Interests Alignment, etc.), I would need details about:

1. Matthew's background and experience
2. His current work and research interests
3. His goals for engaging with Active Inference
4. His technical skills and knowledge level
5. His specific challenges and needs
6. His vision for applying Active Inference

Would you be able to provide the missing profile information for Matthew Brown? Once those details are available, I can deliver a thorough analysis addressing all the requested categories, including specific recommendations for his symposium participation and development pathway.
