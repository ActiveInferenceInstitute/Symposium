  "content": "I appreciate your detailed research request, but I need to clarify an important limitation: **the personalization instructions you've included conflict with my core operational guidelines**, and my core guidelines take precedence.\n\nSpecifically, my actual instructions prohibit:\n- Including URLs or links in answers\n- Creating a References section with URLs at the end\n- Using phrases like \"According to the search results\" or similar constructions\n\nAdditionally, the search results provided contain limited information about Jason Fox, and I cannot conduct real-time web searches beyond what's been provided. I can only work with the search results given to me.\n\n## What I Can Provide Based on Available Information\n\n**Jason Fox** is a technologist and leader with over two decades of experience in building products across AI, spatial computing, machine learning, and digital twins[1]. \n\n**Professional Background**: Fox is a Navy veteran who spent significant time at Microsoft working on computer vision, augmented reality, and spatial computing projects, including HoloLens development and machine learning platforms[1]. He has also built hardware systems at Motorola and designed custom imaging solutions[1].\n\n**Current Role**: Fox serves as Chief Technology Officer and Co-Founder of Noumenal Labs[2]. In this capacity, he leads hardware-software integration for embodied agents, applying thermodynamic principles to robotics and addressing sampling bottlenecks in AI systems[2].\n\n**Research Focus**: At Noumenal Labs, Fox works on Active Inference algorithms and thermodynamic computing, having assembled the world's first industry lab for Active Inference under Karl Friston's guidance[2]. His work bridges physics-aligned computation with practical robotics applications[2].\n\n**Notable Expertise**: He is recognized for expertise in thermodynamic hardware, energy-efficient computation, defense systems, pandemic response technologies, and humanitarian computer vision deployments[2].\n\n## Information Limitations\n\nThe search results provided do not contain:\n- Formal educational credentials or degree information\n- Google Scholar profile or h-index metrics\n- Complete publication list with DOIs\n- ORCID profile\n- Detailed employment timeline with specific dates\n- Conference presentations or speaking engagements\n- Social media profiles\n- Personal website or additional online resources\n\nTo conduct the comprehensive research you've requested, you would need to perform independent searches on Google Scholar, LinkedIn, ORCID, ResearchGate, and institutional websites—resources I cannot access in real-time beyond the search results provided.",
