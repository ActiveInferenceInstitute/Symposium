Based on Andrius's unique background and stated needs, I'll design a specialized curriculum that emphasizes critical dialogue and mathematical foundations while addressing his concerns about Active Inference's theoretical frameworks.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Strong mathematical foundation (PhD in Math, BA in Physics)
- Advanced understanding of Active Inference's mathematical foundations
- Critical perspective on current Active Inference frameworks
- Interest in dialogue-based learning and philosophical examination
- Gaps: Need for broader critical discourse and alternative interpretations

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Focus: Critical Analysis and Alternative Frameworks
- Month 1-2: Mathematical Foundations Review & Alternative Interpretations
- Month 3-4: Comparative Analysis of Frameworks
- Month 5-6: Development of Novel Interpretations
- Month 7-12: Community Building and Dialogue

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
Module 1: Mathematical Foundations Reimagined
- Your simplified derivations of key equations
- Alternative mathematical frameworks
- Comparative analysis with standard approaches

Module 2: Critical Theory Analysis
- Examination of Active Inference presuppositions
- Historical development of ideas
- Alternative interpretations of core concepts

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
- Development of mathematical proofs and alternative derivations
- Creation of comparative frameworks
- Organization of critical dialogue sessions
- Documentation of alternative interpretations

5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**
- Cross-disciplinary applications (physics, economics)
- Alternative frameworks for subjective experience
- Mathematical simplification techniques
- Integration with other theoretical approaches

6. **PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS**
- Application to Math 4 Wisdom community
- Development of simplified teaching materials
- Integration with Wondrous Wisdom language
- Critical analysis framework development

7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**
- Organization of dialogue sessions with identified contacts
- Creation of critical discussion groups
- Development of collaborative research projects
- Integration with Math 4 Wisdom community

8. **ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION**
- Development of alternative mathematical frameworks
- Publication of critical analyses
- Community engagement metrics
- Collaborative research outputs

9. **RESOURCES AND TOOLS**
Recommended Reading:
- Original Active Inference papers for critical analysis
- Alternative frameworks in cognitive science
- Philosophy of science literature
- Mathematical modeling in cognitive science

Tools:
- Collaborative platforms for mathematical discussion
- Virtual meeting tools for dialogue sessions
- Documentation and publication platforms

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

Short-term (1-3 months):
- Document simplified mathematical derivations
- Initiate dialogue with identified contacts
- Begin critical analysis documentation

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Develop alternative mathematical framework
- Organize regular dialogue sessions
- Create comparative analysis documents

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Publish critical analysis and alternative frameworks
- Establish regular community dialogue sessions
- Integrate findings with Math 4 Wisdom platform

This curriculum emphasizes:
- Critical dialogue and discussion
- Mathematical simplification and clarity
- Alternative interpretations and frameworks
- Community building and collaboration
- Integration with existing work in Math 4 Wisdom

The approach focuses on addressing your specific concerns about Active Inference while leveraging your mathematical expertise and interest in dialogue-based learning. The curriculum is designed to be flexible and can be adjusted based on findings and discussions.
