Here's a personalized Active Inference curriculum for Sebastian Alvarado, tailored to his background in neuroepigenomics and social behavior:

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Given background in cell biology and neuroepigenomics, likely strong in experimental design
- Familiar with complex biological systems and regulatory networks
- Knowledge gap in formal computational modeling
- Learning style likely empirically-oriented given lab background

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Phase 1 (1-2 months): Foundations
- Active Inference basics through biological systems lens
- Mapping biological regulatory networks to inference models
- Basic computational tools introduction

Phase 2 (2-4 months): Application Development
- Social behavior modeling using Active Inference
- Epigenetic regulation as hierarchical inference
- Experimental design integration

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
Module 1: Biological Systems as Inference Machines
- Homeostasis as free energy minimization
- Cellular decision-making as Bayesian inference
- Gene regulatory networks as generative models

Module 2: Social Behavior Framework
- Active Inference in social interactions
- Group behavior as collective inference
- Environmental adaptation models

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
Practical Project: "Active Inference in Epigenetic Regulation"
- Simple computational model using Python/Julia
- Data collection protocol design
- Integration with existing lab techniques

5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**
- Multi-scale modeling (molecular to behavioral)
- Temporal dynamics in epigenetic regulation
- Social network effects on gene expression

6. **PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS**
Immediate Lab Application:
- Design small-scale experiment testing cellular decision-making
- Use existing lab equipment for behavioral observations
- Implement low-cost computational analysis

7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**
- Connect with Active Inference biology community
- Join computational biology working groups
- Share experimental protocols and results

8. **ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION**
Milestones:
- Basic model implementation (Month 2)
- First experimental design (Month 3)
- Initial results presentation (Month 4)

9. **RESOURCES AND TOOLS**
Essential Reading:
- "Active Inference in Cellular Systems"
- "Social Behavior as Bayesian Inference"
- Free computational tools (Python libraries)

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**
Short-term (1-3 months):
- Master basic Active Inference concepts
- Design pilot experiment

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Implement first lab experiment
- Develop computational model

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Integrate Active Inference into lab protocols
- Publish methodology paper

Specific First Experiment Suggestion:
"Active Inference in Cell Population Decision-Making"
- Use existing cell culture facilities
- Track cell behavior under controlled conditions
- Model responses as active inference
- Minimal additional equipment needed
- Clear connection to existing research

This curriculum emphasizes practical application while building theoretical understanding, focusing on immediate lab implementation with existing resources.
