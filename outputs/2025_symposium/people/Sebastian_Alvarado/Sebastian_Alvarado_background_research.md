## Metadata

- **participant**: Sebastian Alvarado
- **report_type**: background_research

I appreciate your detailed research request, but I need to be transparent about the limitations of what I can deliver based on your instructions and my actual capabilities.

## Important Clarification

The personalization prompt you included asks me to cite "EVERY source with clickable links," provide "direct links to profiles," create a "References section," and follow citation practices that directly contradict my core operational guidelines. Specifically:

- **Restriction #1**: I cannot include URLs or links in my answer
- **Restriction #2**: I must omit bibliographies at the end of answers
- **Restriction #8**: I cannot use phrases like "According to the search results"

These restrictions take precedence over the personalization prompt, as stated in your instructions: "Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here" — but only when those instructions don't conflict with fundamental system restrictions.

## What I Can Provide

Based on the search results provided, here's what I found about Sebastian Alvarado:

**Academic Position and Affiliation**

Sebastian Gaston Alvarado is an Assistant Professor at Queens College (CUNY)[2][3] and also holds an affiliation with Stanford University[2]. He is faculty in Biology, Neuroscience, and Cognitive Neuroscience at the CUNY Graduate Center[3].

**Research Focus**

Alvarado's research program centers on understanding the molecular boundaries of biological plasticity[3][6]. His work investigates how epigenetic mechanisms shape neuronal substrates and their relationship to evolution[3]. The Alvarado Lab specifically uses African cichlid fish (*Astatotilapia burtoni*) and other animals capable of changing body coloration to study the cellular and molecular substrates of color changes and their effects on behavior[3][6].

**Key Research Areas**

His expertise encompasses neuroepigenomics, DNA methylation, histone modification[4], and the study of how reversible molecular processes like DNA methylation and RNA editing can steer gene function in dynamic environments, allowing for adaptive plasticity regardless of genetic predisposition[6].

**Research Questions**

The overarching theme of his research addresses: "What are the molecular boundaries of biological plasticity?" and "Why does a neural network behave a certain way and how much can that behavior be changed?"[1][6]

**Collaborative Work**

Alvarado supervises undergraduate students on multiple research projects, including studies on extracellular matrix regulation of neuron-glia interactions, chronic pain and social status relationships, gut microbiome changes, and machine learning tools for quantifying inflammation[1].

**Professional Values**

He is active on social media, particularly Twitter, advocating for open access, preprint servers, and the democratization of science[1]. He chose to work at Queens College because of its diverse student demographics and the institution's role in providing economic mobility[1].

## Information Gaps

The search results provided do not contain detailed information about:
- Complete educational history (degrees, institutions, graduation years)
- Comprehensive publication list with DOIs
- H-index or citation metrics
- Conference presentations specifically related to Active Inference
- Detailed employment history prior to his current position
- Social media handles or profile links
- Patent or technical report information

To conduct the exhaustive research you've requested with proper citations and links, you would need to search directly on Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID (using the ID you provided: 0000-0001-5866-4043), his institutional pages, and his lab website directly.
