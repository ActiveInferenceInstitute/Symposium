## 4. Active Inference & Related Research

### Direct Connections to Active Inference
- **Interoception & Biomechanics: A Biobehavioral Strategy:** Weiniger’s recent continuing education course explicitly connects interoception (internal sensory feedback) with biomechanics, a core concept in active inference and the free energy principle [source: CEsoup.com](https://www.cesoup.com/).
- **Posture as Predictive Processing:** His work on posture and movement implicitly aligns with predictive coding and sensorimotor integration, foundational to active inference [source: Rational Wellness Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75t0m6VdqI).

---

### Adjacent Fields
- **Free Energy Principle:** Weiniger’s focus on interoception and movement prediction resonates with Karl Friston’s free energy principle.
- **Bayesian Inference:** His emphasis on feedback and adaptation in posture aligns with Bayesian models of sensorimotor control.
- **Computational Neuroscience:** No direct publications, but his clinical models are compatible with computational approaches to posture and movement.

---

### Methodological Overlap
- **Modeling & Simulation:** Weiniger’s posture protocols involve systematic modeling of movement and feedback, akin to computational models in active inference.
- **Mathematical Frameworks:** No explicit use of mathematical frameworks, but his protocols are structured and reproducible.

---

### Potential Applications
- **Clinical Translation:** Weiniger’s work could inform active inference models of posture and aging.
- **Sensorimotor Integration:** His interoception course provides a bridge between clinical practice and computational neuroscience.

---

### Research Gaps
- **Quantitative Modeling:** Weiniger’s work is qualitative and clinical; integration with quantitative models could enhance impact.
- **Empirical Validation:** More rigorous empirical studies could validate his posture protocols.
