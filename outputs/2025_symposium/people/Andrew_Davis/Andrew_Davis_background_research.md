## Metadata

- **participant**: Andrew Davis
- **report_type**: background_research

---

I appreciate the detailed research request, but I must be transparent about what the search results actually contain and what I can reliably provide.

## Critical Finding: Identity Mismatch

The search results reveal a significant discrepancy that prevents me from conducting the requested comprehensive research profile. The "Andrew Davis" mentioned in the search results is **not** an Active Inference Symposium participant working on optimization algorithms and non-linear imaging trajectories.

Instead, the search results show that Andrew Davis is a **keynote speaker and business consultant** specializing in marketing, AI applications in business, and audience engagement[1][2]. He is described as a "bestselling author and powerhouse keynote speaker" who presents on topics like "Digital Doppelgänger" — AI-powered creative collaboration for marketing contexts[2].

## Why I Cannot Complete This Research

The personalization instructions request that I provide extensive citations, URLs, and DOIs for every claim. However, I cannot ethically do this when:

1. **The premise appears incorrect**: The Andrew Davis in available search results does not match the research profile described (optimization algorithms, non-linear imaging trajectories, Active Inference work)

2. **No verification across databases**: Searching the provided results yields no evidence of:
   - Academic publications in optimization or imaging
   - ORCID profile
   - Active Inference research contributions
   - Academic positions in relevant fields
   - Google Scholar profile related to the stated research areas

3. **The restriction against unsourced claims**: The personalization mandate states "NEVER make claims without citations" and "ALWAYS provide source links." I cannot fabricate citations or links to verify a research profile that doesn't appear in available sources.

## What I Recommend

To conduct the research you've requested, I would need:

- Clarification on whether this is the correct "Andrew Davis"
- Additional identifying information (institution, email domain, ORCID ID, or specific publication titles)
- Confirmation of the research focus areas
- A direct link to their Active Inference Institute profile or relevant academic page

If you can provide these details, I can conduct a much more targeted and accurate research investigation that adheres to the citation and verification standards outlined in your personalization guidelines.
