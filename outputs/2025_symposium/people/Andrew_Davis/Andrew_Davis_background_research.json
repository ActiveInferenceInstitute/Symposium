  "content": "I appreciate the detailed research request, but I must be transparent about what the search results actually contain and what I can reliably provide.\n\n## Critical Finding: Identity Mismatch\n\nThe search results reveal a significant discrepancy that prevents me from conducting the requested comprehensive research profile. The \"Andrew Davis\" mentioned in the search results is **not** an Active Inference Symposium participant working on optimization algorithms and non-linear imaging trajectories.\n\nInstead, the search results show that Andrew Davis is a **keynote speaker and business consultant** specializing in marketing, AI applications in business, and audience engagement[1][2]. He is described as a \"bestselling author and powerhouse keynote speaker\" who presents on topics like \"Digital Doppelgänger\" — AI-powered creative collaboration for marketing contexts[2].\n\n## Why I Cannot Complete This Research\n\nThe personalization instructions request that I provide extensive citations, URLs, and DOIs for every claim. However, I cannot ethically do this when:\n\n1. **The premise appears incorrect**: The Andrew Davis in available search results does not match the research profile described (optimization algorithms, non-linear imaging trajectories, Active Inference work)\n\n2. **No verification across databases**: Searching the provided results yields no evidence of:\n   - Academic publications in optimization or imaging\n   - ORCID profile\n   - Active Inference research contributions\n   - Academic positions in relevant fields\n   - Google Scholar profile related to the stated research areas\n\n3. **The restriction against unsourced claims**: The personalization mandate states \"NEVER make claims without citations\" and \"ALWAYS provide source links.\" I cannot fabricate citations or links to verify a research profile that doesn't appear in available sources.\n\n## What I Recommend\n\nTo conduct the research you've requested, I would need:\n\n- Clarification on whether this is the correct \"Andrew Davis\"\n- Additional identifying information (institution, email domain, ORCID ID, or specific publication titles)\n- Confirmation of the research focus areas\n- A direct link to their Active Inference Institute profile or relevant academic page\n\nIf you can provide these details, I can conduct a much more targeted and accurate research investigation that adheres to the citation and verification standards outlined in your personalization guidelines.",
