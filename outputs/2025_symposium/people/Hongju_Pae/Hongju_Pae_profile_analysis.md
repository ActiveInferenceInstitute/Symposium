- Their academic/professional background

If you could provide any of this information about Hongju Pae, I would be happy to analyze those specific aspects and offer relevant recommendations for:
1. Learning opportunities
2. Research directions
3. Collaboration potential
4. Symposium participation strategy
5. Development roadmap

Would you be able to share any additional details about Hongju Pae's profile?
