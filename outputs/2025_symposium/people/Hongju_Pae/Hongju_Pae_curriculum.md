I notice that several key fields about Hongju Pae's background and needs are currently empty. To create a truly personalized and effective curriculum, I'll need information about:

1. Their background (academic/professional experience, current role)
2. How they're currently applying or planning to apply Active Inference
3. Specific learning needs and goals
4. Current challenges they're facing
5. What practical outcomes they're seeking
6. What theoretical understanding they wish to develop

Could you provide these details so I can design a curriculum that:
- Builds on their existing knowledge
- Addresses their specific challenges
- Aligns with their application goals
- Matches their learning style
- Delivers their desired pragmatic and epistemic outcomes

Once these details are provided, I can create a comprehensive, personalized curriculum that bridges theory and practice in ways most relevant to their situation.

Would you be able to provide more information about Hongju Pae's background and learning objectives?
