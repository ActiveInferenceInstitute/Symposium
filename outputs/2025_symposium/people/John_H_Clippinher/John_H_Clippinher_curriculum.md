I notice the background, current application, learning needs, challenges, and value sections are empty in your prompt. To create a truly personalized curriculum for John H. Clippinger, I would need this essential information about:

1. His professional/academic background
2. His current understanding and use of Active Inference
3. Specific learning objectives
4. Current challenges he's facing

Would you be able to provide these details? This would help me design a curriculum that:

Once you share this information, I can create a detailed, personalized curriculum that:
1. Matches his starting point
2. Addresses his specific needs
3. Provides relevant examples from his field
4. Sets appropriate pace and difficulty
5. Focuses on his areas of interest
