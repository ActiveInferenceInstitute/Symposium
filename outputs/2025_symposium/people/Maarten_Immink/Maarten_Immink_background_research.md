I appreciate your detailed research request, but I need to clarify an important constraint: **my instructions explicitly prohibit me from including URLs, links, or creating a References section with clickable links**, even though your personalization request asks for them. These restrictions are part of my core operational guidelines and take precedence.

However, I can provide you with a comprehensive research profile of Maarten Immink based on the available search results, with citations to the sources provided. Let me conduct the analysis within my actual constraints:

## Academic Background

Maarten A. Immink is an **Associate Professor in Exercise and Sport Science and Clinical Exercise Physiology** at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia, based in the College of Nursing and Health Sciences[2][4][5][6]. His educational and professional trajectory demonstrates specialization in motor learning, sensorimotor control, and the neurocognitive bases of human performance[1][3][4][5].

His research focuses on **mind, brain and human performance**, with particular emphasis on understanding the neurocognitive processes underlying motor behavior[3][5]. His areas of expertise encompass motor learning, skill acquisition, and motor behavior[1], with applications extending to sports performance and clinical exercise physiology[2].

## Research Contributions

Immink's research portfolio includes significant work in applied motor learning contexts. One notable publication addresses **yoga for chronic poststroke hemiparesis**, examining motor function, mental health, and quality of life outcomes through a randomized controlled trial[7].

His recent work, as you noted, includes a publication in *Psychological Research* on Active Inference and motor learning (DOI: 10.1007/s00426-023-01900-1), which represents his entry into computational cognitive science frameworks applied to motor control.

His Google Scholar profile indicates ongoing scholarly productivity in exercise science and motor control research[7].

## Professional Experience & Supervision

Immink has served as **Discipline Lead for Exercise and Sport Science and Clinical Exercise Physiology** at Flinders University[2]. His supervisory experience includes:

- **PhD Principal Supervision**: Valentin Dones (2011-2013, University of South Australia) on lateral epicondylitis and upper extremity neuromechanics, funded by the University President's Scholarship for international students[3]
- **Masters by Research Principal Supervision**: James Brown (2020-2022, University of South Australia) investigating wakeful-dependent motor memory consolidation[3]
- **Masters by Research Co-Supervision**: Keegan Hall (2020-2022, University of South Australia) examining inertia flywheel squat post-activation potentiation protocols[3]
- **Earlier Supervision**: Annette Loudon (2011-2012, University of Tasmania) on yoga and lymphoedema[3]

## Active Inference & Computational Neuroscience Connection

Your self-reported connection to Active Inference through the *Psychological Research* publication (DOI: 10.1007/s00426-023-01900-1) represents a **direct intersection** between Immink's traditional motor learning expertise and contemporary computational frameworks. This publication bridges his established domain of motor behavior with Bayesian inference and predictive processing models, positioning him at the interface between classical sports science and computational cognitive science.

This work aligns with the broader movement toward understanding motor control through free energy minimization and predictive coding frameworks—core concepts in Active Inference theory.

## Research Positioning for Active Inference

Immink's expertise in **neurocognitive processes underlying motor performance** provides natural leverage for Active Inference research. His established work on motor learning and skill acquisition could inform computational models of how agents minimize prediction error during motor adaptation—a central tenet of Active Inference. His clinical experience with rehabilitation (poststroke hemiparesis) positions him to translate Active Inference principles into therapeutic applications.

**Note on Research Limitations**: The search results provided contain limited information about recent publications, conference presentations, or detailed collaborative networks. To obtain a truly comprehensive profile including full publication lists, citation metrics (h-index), recent preprints, social media presence, and detailed collaboration networks, you would need to directly access his full Google Scholar profile, ResearchGate account, institutional research database, and professional networks, which I cannot provide links to per my operational constraints.
