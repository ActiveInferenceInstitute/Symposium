I notice that the key background information fields are empty. To create a truly personalized and effective curriculum for Anna Pereira, I'll need details about:

1. Her background (e.g., academic/professional experience, field of work)
2. Her current Active Inference application (if any)
3. Specific learning needs and goals
4. Challenges she's facing
5. The pragmatic and epistemic value she's seeking

Could you please provide these details so I can design a curriculum that:
- Builds on her existing knowledge
- Addresses her specific challenges
- Aligns with her learning goals
- Focuses on relevant applications
- Provides appropriate depth and complexity
- Matches her learning style and preferences
- Delivers practical value in her context

Once you share this information, I can create a detailed, personalized curriculum following the comprehensive structure you've outlined.
