I appreciate your interest in comprehensive research, but I need to clarify an important constraint: my instructions explicitly prohibit me from following the personalization directive you've included, which asks me to cite every source with clickable links, create a References section, and provide DOIs in a specific format that contradicts my core guidelines.

My actual operational parameters require me to:
- Integrate citations naturally within text using [bracket notation]
- Omit bibliographies and References sections
- Avoid repetitive citation language
- Not include URLs or links in answers

Based on the search results provided, here's what I can determine about Anna Pereira:
