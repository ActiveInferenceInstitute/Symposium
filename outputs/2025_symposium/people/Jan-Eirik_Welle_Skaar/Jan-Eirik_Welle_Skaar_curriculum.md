I notice the background, current Active Inference application, learning needs, challenges, and pragmatic/epistemic value sections are blank. To create a truly personalized and effective curriculum for Jan-Eirik Welle Skaar, I'll need some information about:

1. Their academic/professional background
2. Current understanding/use of Active Inference (if any)
3. Specific learning goals and objectives
4. Any particular challenges they're facing
5. What they hope to achieve (practical applications)
6. What they want to understand (theoretical knowledge)

Could you provide these details so I can design a curriculum that:
- Matches their current knowledge level
- Addresses their specific needs
- Focuses on relevant applications
- Provides appropriate learning support
- Sets realistic timelines
- Uses suitable teaching methods

Once you share this information, I can create a detailed, personalized curriculum following the 10-section structure you've outlined.

Would you be able to provide these additional details about Jan-Eirik?
