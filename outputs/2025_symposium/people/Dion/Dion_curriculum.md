I notice that key information about Dion's background, current Active Inference application, learning needs, challenges, and desired pragmatic/epistemic values is missing. To create a truly personalized and effective curriculum, I'll need these details.

Could you please provide:

1. **Background:**
- Academic/professional background
- Current field of work/study
- Prior exposure to related concepts (e.g., Bayesian inference, machine learning, cognitive science)

2. **Current Active Inference Application:**
- How they currently use or plan to use Active Inference
- Specific domain of application
- Current projects or research interests

3. **Learning Needs:**
- Specific skills they want to develop
- Knowledge gaps they've identified
- Learning priorities

4. **Challenges:**
- Current obstacles in understanding/applying Active Inference
- Time constraints or resource limitations
- Technical or conceptual hurdles

5. **Pragmatic Value Sought:**
- Practical outcomes they hope to achieve
- Specific problems they want to solve
- Applied skills they want to develop

6. **Epistemic Value Sought:**
- Theoretical understanding they wish to gain
- Research questions they want to explore
- Conceptual frameworks they want to master

Once you provide these details, I can design a highly personalized curriculum that:
- Builds on their existing knowledge
- Addresses their specific challenges
- Aligns with their learning style
- Focuses on their practical needs
- Supports their long-term goals

Would you please share these details about Dion?
