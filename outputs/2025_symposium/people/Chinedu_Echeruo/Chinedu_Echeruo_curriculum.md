I notice the background, current Active Inference application, learning needs, challenges, and pragmatic/epistemic values are not provided for Chinedu Echeruo. To create a truly personalized curriculum, I'll need those details.

However, I can provide a preliminary curriculum framework that we can refine once those details are available:

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Initial consultation meeting to determine:
  * Prior exposure to Bayesian inference and information theory
  * Mathematical background level
  * Domain expertise and application interests
  * Learning style preferences
  * Time availability and commitment level

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
- Flexible modular structure adaptable to:
  * Professional background
  * Technical sophistication
  * Application domain
  * Available time commitment
  * Learning pace preference

Would you be able to provide more information about Chinedu's:
- Academic/professional background
- Current work/research focus
- Specific learning objectives
- Main challenges they're trying to address
- What they hope to practically achieve
- What they want to understand deeply

This would allow me to:
1. Calibrate the technical depth appropriately
2. Select relevant examples and applications
3. Structure the progression optimally
4. Choose appropriate tools and resources
5. Design suitable assessment methods
6. Recommend specific community connections

Please provide these details so I can create a truly personalized curriculum that will be most effective for Chinedu's specific needs and goals.
