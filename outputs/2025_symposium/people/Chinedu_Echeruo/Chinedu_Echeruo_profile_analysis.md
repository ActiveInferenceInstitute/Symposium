I apologize, but I don't have enough information in the prompt about Chinedu Echeruo to provide a comprehensive profile analysis. To conduct a thorough analysis as requested, I would need specific details about:

- Their academic and professional background
- Current work and research interests
- Prior experience with Active Inference
- Specific goals for participating in the symposium
- Current projects or applications they're working on
- Technical expertise and domain knowledge
- Research interests and focus areas

Without this information, any analysis would be speculative. However, I can note that Chinedu Echeruo is known as an entrepreneur and innovator, having founded multiple companies including HopStop (acquired by Apple). If you could provide more specific information about their current work, interests, and goals related to Active Inference, I would be happy to provide a detailed analysis following the structure you've outlined.

To proceed with a meaningful analysis, it would be helpful to know:

1. Their current involvement with Active Inference
2. Specific research or practical interests in the field
3. Technical background and expertise level
4. Goals for participating in the symposium
5. Current projects or applications they're working on
6. Learning objectives and challenges they're facing

With this additional information, I could provide a more accurate and useful profile analysis.
