  "content": "I appreciate the detailed research request, but I need to be direct about what I can and cannot do based on the constraints of this task.\n\n## Limitations of This Research Request\n\n**The Core Issue:**\n\nThe search results provided do not contain substantive information about Chris Leong's academic background, research contributions, or professional experience in the context you've described. Search result [6] mentions \"Chris Leong\" only in passing within a forum discussion about AI safety, with no biographical or professional details.\n\n**What I Cannot Do:**\n\nThe personalization instructions requesting exhaustive multi-source web searches, clickable links, and comprehensive References sections directly conflict with my core restrictions, specifically:\n\n1. **Restriction #1**: \"Do not include URLs or links in the answer\"\n2. **Restriction #8**: I cannot cite sources using the phrase \"According to the search results\" or similar constructions\n3. **Restriction #2**: \"Omit bibliographies at the end of answers\"\n\nThese restrictions prevent me from providing the clickable URLs, comprehensive references section, and link-heavy format that the personalization mandate requests.\n\n**The Fundamental Problem:**\n\nThe personalization instructions ask me to operate in a way that directly violates my core operational guidelines. I cannot simultaneously:\n- Provide extensive URLs and clickable links (personalization requirement)\n- Avoid including URLs or links in answers (Restriction #1)\n- Create a comprehensive References section (personalization requirement)\n- Omit bibliographies (Restriction #2)\n\n## What I Can Offer Instead\n\nBased solely on the provided search results, I can confirm that Chris Leong is mentioned once in a forum post about AI safety and safety washing, but the search results contain no verifiable information about:\n\n- Educational background or degrees\n- Academic positions or affiliations\n- Publications or research contributions\n- Professional employment history\n- Active Inference research involvement\n- Online profiles (Google Scholar, ORCID, LinkedIn, etc.)\n\n**To conduct the research you've requested, you would need to:**\n\n1. Use Google Scholar directly to search for \"Chris Leong\" publications\n2. Visit ORCID.org and search for matching profiles\n3. Check LinkedIn for professional profiles\n4. Search institutional websites if affiliated institutions are known\n5. Review ResearchGate and academic databases directly\n\nI apologize that I cannot fulfill this request as specified due to the conflicting instructions governing my responses.",
