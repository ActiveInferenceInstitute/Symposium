Based on Chris's background in risk management, governance, and compliance for responsible innovation, I'll design a tailored Active Inference curriculum that emphasizes practical applications while building fundamental understanding.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Starting from basic principles given limited prior exposure
- Strong analytical background in risk management can be leveraged
- Professional experience suggests preference for practical, application-focused learning
- Governance background indicates interest in systematic frameworks

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Months 1-2: Foundations
