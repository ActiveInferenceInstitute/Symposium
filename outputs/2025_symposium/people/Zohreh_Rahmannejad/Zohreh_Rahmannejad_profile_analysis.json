Without access to their research publications, professional background, or stated interests in Active Inference, I cannot make specific assessments or recommendations.\n\nTo provide an accurate and helpful analysis, I would need information about:\n\n1. Their academic/professional background\n2. Current research interests\n3. Published works\n4. Expertise areas\n5. Stated goals for engaging with Active Inference\n6. Current projects or applications\n7. Specific learning objectives\n\nWhat I can suggest is a general framework for assessing any symposium participant:\n\n1. **Initial Assessment**\n- Review their published works\n- Examine their current research focus\n- Understand their domain expertise\n\n2. **Gap Analysis**\n- Identify knowledge gaps in Active Inference\n- Map current expertise to potential applications\n- Determine required skills development\n\n3. **Participation Strategy**\n- Focus on relevant symposium sessions\n- Identify key networking opportunities\n- Plan specific learning objectives\n\nWould you be able to provide any additional information about Zohreh Rahmannejad that would allow for a more detailed and personalized analysis?",
