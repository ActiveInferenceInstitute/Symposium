I apologize, but I don't have enough information about Zohreh Rahmannejad's background, research interests, or current work to provide a detailed profile analysis. Without access to their research publications, professional background, or stated interests in Active Inference, I cannot make specific assessments or recommendations.

To provide an accurate and helpful analysis, I would need information about:

1. Their academic/professional background
2. Current research interests
3. Published works
4. Expertise areas
5. Stated goals for engaging with Active Inference
6. Current projects or applications
7. Specific learning objectives

What I can suggest is a general framework for assessing any symposium participant:

1. **Initial Assessment**
- Review their published works
- Examine their current research focus
- Understand their domain expertise

2. **Gap Analysis**
- Identify knowledge gaps in Active Inference
- Map current expertise to potential applications
- Determine required skills development

3. **Participation Strategy**
- Focus on relevant symposium sessions
- Identify key networking opportunities
- Plan specific learning objectives

Would you be able to provide any additional information about Zohreh Rahmannejad that would allow for a more detailed and personalized analysis?
