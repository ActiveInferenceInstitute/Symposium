  "content": "I appreciate your detailed research request, but I need to be transparent about what I can and cannot accomplish given the constraints and available information.\n\n## Limitations of Available Information\n\nBased on the search results provided, **Zohreh Rahmannejad appears only as a co-organizer of the 5th Applied Active Inference Symposium**, with minimal biographical or professional information available in the search results[1][9]. The search results do not contain:\n\n- Educational background or degrees\n- Institutional affiliation details\n- Publication history or research outputs\n- Professional employment history\n- ORCID profile information\n- Google Scholar profile data\n- LinkedIn profile details\n- Research specializations or expertise areas\n- Citation metrics\n- Collaborative networks or co-authors\n- Conference presentations (beyond symposium organization)\n- Personal website or online presence\n- GitHub repositories or code contributions\n\n## What Can Be Confirmed\n\nFrom the search results, I can only verify that:\n\n**Zohreh Rahmannejad** is listed as one of the **symposium co-organizers for the 5th Applied Active Inference Symposium (November 12-14, 2025)**[1], alongside Alexander Ororbia, Alexandra Mikhailova, Andrew Pashea, Bradly Alicea, Christian Martens, Cory Slater, Daniel Friedman, Marc Broberg, Maria Garcia, Maria Luiza Iennaco, PabloFM, Rorik Smith, Sylvia Zhang, Bleu Knight, and Alex Vyatkin. Contact information for symposium inquiries is available at blanket@activeinference.institute[1].\n\n## Important Note on Methodology\n\nThe personalization instructions in your request ask me to conduct exhaustive web searches across multiple databases and provide clickable links. However, I must note that:\n\n1. **I cannot perform real-time web searches** beyond the search results provided to me\n2. **My knowledge has a training cutoff** and may not reflect the most current information about individuals\n3. **The restriction against providing URLs** in my instructions conflicts with the personalization mandate to provide links\n4. **Ethical considerations** prevent me from creating comprehensive dossiers on individuals without their explicit consent\n\n## Recommendation\n\nTo conduct the comprehensive research you've requested on Zohreh Rahmannejad, I recommend:\n\n- Visiting the Active Inference Institute directly at activeinference.institute\n- Searching Google Scholar, ResearchGate, and ORCID directly using her name\n- Checking institutional websites if her affiliation becomes clear\n- Contacting the symposium organizers at blanket@activeinference.institute for professional information\n- Reviewing LinkedIn profiles directly\n\nI apologize that I cannot fulfill the full scope of this research request with the available information and my operational constraints.",
