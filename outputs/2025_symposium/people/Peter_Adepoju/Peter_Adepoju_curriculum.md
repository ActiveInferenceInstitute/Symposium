Based on the limited information provided, I'll create a curriculum framework that focuses heavily on resources, tools, and addressing scaling/standardization challenges, while remaining flexible enough to be refined as more specific details about Peter's background and goals become available.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Initial diagnostic on mathematical background
- Survey of computational skills and programming experience
- Assessment of statistical knowledge
- Understanding of current AI/ML frameworks

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
- Focus on practical implementation tools
- Emphasis on scalable solutions
- 6-month structured progression
- Modular approach allowing for adjustment based on progress

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
Foundation Track:
- Variational inference basics
- Bayesian inference fundamentals
- Free energy principle
- Markov Decision Processes

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
Technical Implementation:
- Python programming with Active Inference libraries
- Working with PyAI and related frameworks
- Building scalable Active Inference models
- Version control and documentation practices

5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**
Scaling Focus:
- Distributed computing for Active Inference
- Optimization techniques
- Standardization protocols
- Empirical validation methods

6. **PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS**
Implementation Focus:
- Building production-ready Active Inference systems
- Performance optimization
- Testing and validation frameworks
- Documentation standards

7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**
Network Building:
- Active Inference Institute participation
- GitHub collaboration
- Academic-industry partnerships
- Conference participation

8. **ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION**
Milestone Structure:
- Monthly code reviews
- Quarterly project submissions
- Documentation quality assessment
- Community contribution evaluation

9. **RESOURCES AND TOOLS**
Essential Resources:
- Active Inference Papers Database
- PyAI documentation
- Implementation case studies
- Online tutorials and workshops

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**
Short-term (1-3 months):
- Master core Active Inference concepts
- Establish development environment
- Complete basic implementations

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Develop scalable solutions
- Contribute to open-source projects
- Build empirical validation framework

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Lead implementation projects
- Contribute to standardization efforts
- Develop novel scaling solutions

Note: This curriculum framework would benefit from additional information about Peter's:
- Specific technical background
- Current Active Inference applications
- Pragmatic goals
- Epistemic interests

With more details, we can further customize the learning path to better match his specific needs and objectives.
