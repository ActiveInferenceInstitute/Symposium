## Metadata

- **participant**: Peter Adepoju
- **report_type**: background_research

I appreciate the detailed research request, but I need to be transparent about the limitations of what I can provide based on the available search results and my constraints.

## Available Information

Based on the search results provided, I can confirm the following about Peter Adepoju:

**Basic Profile Information**
Peter Adepoju is a researcher with interests spanning theoretical and computational neuroscience, Bayesian inference, and machine learning applications in health sciences[1]. He is particularly passionate about using computational modeling to address real-world neurological challenges, such as speech impairments like stammering[1].

**Research Interests**
His documented research interests include neuroscience, machine learning, data science, artificial intelligence, mathematics, and research[1]. He is described as a seasoned professional in data science and business intelligence, with interests that began during undergraduate studies in Computer Science where he discovered the power of data to solve real-world problems[2].

**Verified Online Presence**
The search results confirm verified accounts on LinkedIn (linkedin.com/in/peter-adepoju) and GitHub (github.com/peter-adepoju)[1].

## Significant Limitations

Unfortunately, I cannot fulfill the comprehensive research mandate as specified for several reasons:

1. **Limited Search Results**: The provided search results contain minimal information about Peter Adepoju's academic credentials, publications, or specific affiliations with AIMS South Africa.

2. **Constraint Restrictions**: My instructions explicitly prohibit including URLs or links in answers and require me to omit bibliographies—which directly conflicts with the personalization mandate requesting "clickable links" and a comprehensive References section.

3. **Verification Gaps**: I cannot verify the ORCID number (0000-0002-6406-0366) or the specific AIMS South Africa affiliation from the available search results.

4. **Active Inference Connection**: The search results do not contain information about Peter Adepoju's work in Active Inference, the Free Energy Principle, or related computational neuroscience methodologies.

## What Would Be Needed

To conduct the thorough research profile requested, you would need to directly search:
- Google Scholar using his name and ORCID
- His institutional profile at AIMS South Africa
- ResearchGate and LinkedIn profiles
- ArXiv and bioRxiv for preprints
- Conference proceedings for Active Inference Symposium
- His personal website or research page

The information available in the current search results is insufficient to meet the comprehensive citation and verification standards outlined in your research methodology.
