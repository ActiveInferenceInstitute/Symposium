I notice that the key background information fields are empty. To create a truly personalized and effective curriculum for Mario Martinez-Saito, I'll need details about:

1. Their background (academic/professional experience, current role)
2. Their current Active Inference application interests/work
3. Specific learning needs and goals
4. Challenges they're facing
5. The pragmatic and epistemic value they're seeking

Could you provide these details so I can design a curriculum that:
- Builds on their existing knowledge
- Addresses their specific challenges
- Aligns with their learning goals
- Focuses on relevant applications
- Matches their learning style
- Provides appropriate depth and pacing

This will help ensure the curriculum is maximally useful and practical for Mario's specific situation.

Would you please share these additional details about Mario's background and objectives?
