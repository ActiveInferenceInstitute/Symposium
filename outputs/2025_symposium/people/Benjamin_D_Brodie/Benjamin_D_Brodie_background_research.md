## Metadata

- **participant**: Benjamin D. Brodie
- **report_type**: background_research

---

After exhaustive and comprehensive web research, no verifiable, relevant information was found on an **Active Inference Symposium participant named Benjamin D. Brodie affiliated with itonomi**. The search results exclusively pertain to **Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie (1783–1862)**, a historical English surgeon and scientist with no connection to modern-day Active Inference research or the company itonomi.

### Key Points from Search Results:

- **Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie (1783–1862)** was a prominent 19th-century English surgeon, anatomist, and physiologist known for foundational contributions to orthopaedics and pathology [1][2][3].
- He held prestigious positions such as President of the Royal Society and the Royal College of Surgeons and was the first surgeon to be made a baronet [1][2].
- His work focused on surgical diseases, joint pathology, and medical education reform, with no known ties to contemporary computational neuroscience or Active Inference [1][2].
- No online academic profiles, ORCID, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, LinkedIn, or professional information exist for a modern researcher named Benjamin D. Brodie linked to itonomi or Active Inference.
- The search also did not return any publications, patents, or professional experience related to Active Inference or computational neuroscience under this name.

### Inferences and Recommendations:

- It is likely that **Benjamin D. Brodie affiliated with itonomi is a contemporary individual whose detailed academic and professional profile is not publicly indexed or available in standard academic and professional databases** as of this date.
- The historical Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie is unrelated to this inquiry.
- Further investigation may require direct contact with itonomi, Active Inference Symposium organizers, or Benjamin D. Brodie himself for authoritative and updated information.
- Alternatively, verify the spelling, middle initial, or affiliation details for more precise searches.
