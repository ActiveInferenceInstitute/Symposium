I notice that key information about Dion's background, current Active Inference application, learning needs, challenges, and desired pragmatic/epistemic values are missing. To create a truly personalized and effective curriculum, I'll need these details. However, I can help you gather this information by suggesting key questions to ask Dion:

**Background Assessment Questions:**
1. What is your educational/professional background?
2. What is your current level of mathematical/programming expertise?
3. What field(s) are you working in?
4. What prior exposure do you have to Active Inference or related concepts?

**Current Application Questions:**
1. How are you currently using or planning to use Active Inference?
2. What specific problems are you trying to solve?
3. What tools/frameworks are you currently using?

**Learning Needs Questions:**
1. What specific aspects of Active Inference interest you most?
2. What are your immediate learning priorities?
3. What is your preferred learning style (theoretical, practical, mixed)?

**Challenges Questions:**
1. What specific difficulties are you encountering with Active Inference?
2. What resources have you tried that weren't helpful?
3. What time constraints do you have?

**Value Questions:**
1. What practical outcomes are you hoping to achieve?
2. What theoretical understanding do you want to develop?
3. How do you plan to apply this knowledge?

Once you have this information, I can create a highly personalized curriculum that:
- Matches Dion's current knowledge level
- Addresses specific gaps and challenges
- Aligns with their learning style and preferences
- Focuses on their practical applications
- Builds toward their desired outcomes

Would you like me to:
1. Help refine these assessment questions?
2. Create a general Active Inference curriculum that we can customize once we have Dion's information?
3. Focus on specific aspects of the curriculum structure?
