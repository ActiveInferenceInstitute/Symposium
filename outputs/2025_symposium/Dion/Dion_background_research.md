### Context and Possible Reasons

- The name "Dion" may be incomplete or a first name only, complicating identification.
- The participant may be a new or non-publishing member of the Active Inference community, or involved in non-public roles (e.g., workshop attendee without public profile).
- The Active Inference Institute's publicly available participant lists and symposia programs do not provide comprehensive participant details beyond invited speakers and presenters, limiting visibility on all attendees.
