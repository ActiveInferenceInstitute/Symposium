I apologize, but I notice that the profile information for Dion appears to be blank, with no details provided under any of the categories (Background, Pragmatic Value, Epistemic Value, etc.). Without this baseline information, I cannot perform a comprehensive profile analysis.

To provide a meaningful analysis, I would need details about:

1. Dion's background and prior works
2. Their pragmatic and epistemic goals
3. Their current involvement with Active Inference
4. Their learning needs and challenges
5. Their vision for future impact

Once these details are provided, I can:
- Assess their expertise level
- Identify relevant learning opportunities
- Align their research interests
- Suggest collaboration possibilities
- Create a tailored symposium strategy
- Develop a personalized roadmap
- Recommend Active Inference integration approaches

Would you be able to provide the missing profile information for Dion? This would allow me to conduct a thorough analysis and offer specific, actionable recommendations.
