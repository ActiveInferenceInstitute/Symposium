**Spatiotemporal brain complexity quantifies consciousness outside of perturbation paradigms**  
*eLife* 2025;13:eRP98920. DOI: [10.7554/eLife.98920](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.98920)[4][6]  
Authors: Martin Breyton, Jan Fousek, Giovanni Rabuffo, Pierpaolo Sorrentino, Lionel Kusch, Marcello Massimini, Spase Petkoski, Viktor Jirsa  
This paper introduces a novel metric for assessing consciousness based on spatiotemporal brain complexity, validated in both resting state and pharmacologically perturbed conditions (ketamine, propofol)[4][6]. Breyton is the first author and contributed to conceptualization, methodology, investigation, visualization, and writing[5].

**Research Focus Areas and Methodologies**  
Breyton’s recent work focuses on developing and validating metrics for consciousness using high-dimensional neuroimaging data and computational modeling[1][4][6]. Methodologies include complexity analysis, functional repertoire quantification, and group-level classification of brain states under anesthesia[5]. This work bridges clinical pharmacology (drug effects on consciousness) and systems neuroscience (brain dynamics).

## Active Inference & Related Research

**Direct Connections to Active Inference**  
There is no direct evidence in the available sources that Breyton has published on Active Inference per se. His recent work on spatiotemporal complexity and consciousness employs computational and statistical methods relevant to Bayesian inference and brain dynamics, which are conceptually adjacent to Active Inference[1][4][6]. However, the term “Active Inference” does not appear in his publication titles, abstracts, or affiliations.

**Adjacent Fields**  
Breyton’s work intersects with computational neuroscience, systems neuroscience, and clinical pharmacology[1][4][6]. The methodologies—complexity analysis, functional repertoire, and brain state classification—overlap with Bayesian and information-theoretic approaches common in Active Inference research, though not explicitly framed as such[4][6].

**Methodological Overlap**  
Breyton’s research employs mathematical modeling of brain dynamics, simulation of pharmacological perturbations, and statistical classification—methods that are foundational in Active Inference and related fields[4][5][6].

**Potential Applications to Active Inference**  
Breyton’s expertise in quantifying brain states and drug effects using high-dimensional data could be applied to Active Inference models of perception, action, and consciousness. His work provides empirical metrics that could validate or constrain Active Inference theories[4][6].

**Research Gaps**  
Breyton is positioned to address gaps in empirical validation of computational models of consciousness, particularly in clinical and pharmacological contexts. His work could help bridge theoretical Active Inference models with real-world, perturbed brain data[4][6].

## Future Potential & Opportunities

**Emerging Research Directions**  
Breyton’s recent focus on empirical metrics for consciousness suggests potential to expand into theory-driven computational modeling, including Active Inference frameworks[4][6]. His expertise in pharmacological perturbation and brain dynamics positions him to contribute to mechanistic models of how drugs alter perception and action.

**Opportunities in the Active Inference Community**  
Breyton could collaborate with theorists to validate Active Inference models against high-dimensional neuroimaging data, especially in altered states of consciousness. His clinical and pharmacological background offers unique translational opportunities.

**Potential Impact**  
Breyton’s work provides empirical grounding for computational theories of brain function. By linking clinical data to theoretical models, he could help advance the field’s understanding of consciousness, perception, and decision-making[4][6].

**Strategic Collaboration Opportunities**  
Collaboration with computational neuroscientists, Active Inference theorists, and clinical researchers could yield impactful interdisciplinary projects. Potential collaborators include Viktor Jirsa, Karl Friston (not directly cited in Breyton’s work), and other leaders in systems neuroscience and Bayesian brain modeling.

## Critical Assessment

- **Strengths**: Strong publication in a leading journal, international and interdisciplinary collaborations, expertise in both clinical and computational neuroscience, and significant grant support.
- **Limitations**: Limited public academic profile, no evidence of teaching, mentoring, or broader community engagement, and no direct connection to Active Inference literature.
- **Gaps**: Educational background, detailed CV, teaching roles, and broader professional activities are not publicly available. No evidence of code sharing, open science practices, or public outreach.
- **Verification**: All claims are based on verifiable institutional and publication records. Inferences about potential contributions to Active Inference are based on methodological and conceptual overlap, not explicit statements or publications.
