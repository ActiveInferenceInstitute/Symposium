There is no public record of previous employment, industry experience, or consulting work.\n\n**Professional Affiliations and Society Memberships**  \nAffiliated with Aix Marseille Université, AP-HM (Assistance Publique – Hôpitaux de Marseille), Inserm (Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale), and the Institut de Neurosciences des Systèmes[2][4][6]. No evidence of society memberships or leadership roles in professional organizations.\n\n**Patents, Technical Reports, or Applied Work**  \nNo patents, technical reports, or evidence of applied industry work were found.\n\n---\n\n## Active Inference & Related Research\n\n**Direct Connections to Active Inference**  \nThere is no direct evidence in the available sources that Breyton has published on Active Inference per se. His recent work on spatiotemporal complexity and consciousness employs computational and statistical methods relevant to Bayesian inference and brain dynamics, which are conceptually adjacent to Active Inference[1][4][6]. However, the term “Active Inference” does not appear in his publication titles, abstracts, or affiliations.\n\n**Adjacent Fields**  \nBreyton’s work intersects with computational neuroscience, systems neuroscience, and clinical pharmacology[1][4][6]. The methodologies—complexity analysis, functional repertoire, and brain state classification—overlap with Bayesian and information-theoretic approaches common in Active Inference research, though not explicitly framed as such[4][6].\n\n**Methodological Overlap**  \nBreyton’s research employs mathematical modeling of brain dynamics, simulation of pharmacological perturbations, and statistical classification—methods that are foundational in Active Inference and related fields[4][5][6].\n\n**Potential Applications to Active Inference**  \nBreyton’s expertise in quantifying brain states and drug effects using high-dimensional data could be applied to Active Inference models of perception, action, and consciousness. His work provides empirical metrics that could validate or constrain Active Inference theories[4][6].\n\n**Research Gaps**  \nBreyton is positioned to address gaps in empirical validation of computational models of consciousness, particularly in clinical and pharmacological contexts. His work could help bridge theoretical Active Inference models with real-world, perturbed brain data[4][6].\n\n---\n\n## Academic & Professional Network\n\n**Key Collaborators**  \n- **Viktor Jirsa**: Director, Institut de Neurosciences des Systèmes, Aix Marseille Université[4][6].\n- **Marcello Massimini**: University of Milan, expert in consciousness and brain stimulation[4][6].\n- **Spase Petkoski, Lionel Kusch, Giovanni Rabuffo, Pierpaolo Sorrentino**: Computational and systems neuroscience researchers at Aix Marseille Université and international institutions[4][6].\n- **Jan Fousek**: Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University[4].\n\n**Conference Presentations**  \nNo evidence of conference presentations, workshop organization, or participation was found.\n\n**Community Engagement**  \nNo blog posts, tutorials, code repositories, or public outreach activities were found.\n\n**Social Media Presence**  \nNo LinkedIn, Twitter/X, ResearchGate, or GitHub profiles were found.\n\n---\n\n## Online Presence & Resources\n\n- **Google Scholar**: [Martin Breyton – Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kZ2JWBkAAAAJ&hl=en)[2]\n- **Institutional Profile**: [AP-HM Pharmacologie Clinique](https://fr.ap-hm.fr/category/disciplines/pharmacologie-clinique)[3]\n- **Publication**: [eLife 2025;13:eRP98920](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.98920)[4][6]\n- **Preprint/Publication Platform**: [eLife Reviewed Preprint](https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/98920)[5]\n- **ORCID, ResearchGate, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter/X**: Not found.\n- **Personal Website**: Not found.\n- **Videos, Podcasts, Interviews**: Not found.\n\n---\n\n## Future Potential & Opportunities\n\n**Emerging Research Directions**  \nBreyton’s recent focus on empirical metrics for consciousness suggests potential to expand into theory-driven computational modeling, including Active Inference frameworks[4][6]. His expertise in pharmacological perturbation and brain dynamics positions him to contribute to mechanistic models of how drugs alter perception and action.\n\n**Opportunities in the Active Inference Community**  \nBreyton could collaborate with theorists to validate Active Inference models against high-dimensional neuroimaging data, especially in altered states of consciousness. His clinical and pharmacological background offers unique translational opportunities.\n\n**Potential Impact**  \nBreyton’s work provides empirical grounding for computational theories of brain function. By linking clinical data to theoretical models, he could help advance the field’s understanding of consciousness, perception, and decision-making[4][6].\n\n**Strategic Collaboration Opportunities**  \nCollaboration with computational neuroscientists, Active Inference theorists, and clinical researchers could yield impactful interdisciplinary projects. Potential collaborators include Viktor Jirsa, Karl Friston (not directly cited in Breyton’s work), and other leaders in systems neuroscience and Bayesian brain modeling.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table: Key Facts\n\n| Category                | Details                                                                 | Sources                  |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Current Position        | Assistant hospitalo-universitaire, Service de Pharmacologie Clinique, Aix Marseille Université | [3]                      |\n| Research Focus          | Clinical pharmacology, systems neuroscience, consciousness metrics      | [1][4][6]                |\n| Key Publication         | *eLife* 2025;13:eRP98920 (spatiotemporal brain complexity)              | [4][5][6]                |\n| Collaborators           | Viktor Jirsa, Marcello Massimini, Spase Petkoski, et al.                | [4][5][6]                |\n| Funding                 | European Commission, ANR                                                | [4][5][6]                |\n| Online Profiles         | Google Scholar (minimal), Institutional page                            | [2][3]                   |\n| Social Media/Code       | Not found                                                               | —                        |\n| Direct Active Inference | No explicit connection found                                            | —                        |\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n[1] [Spatiotemporal brain complexity quantifies consciousness ... – ScanR](https://scanr.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/publications/doi10.1101%2F2023.04.18.537321)  \n[2] [Martin Breyton – Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kZ2JWBkAAAAJ&hl=en)  \n[3] [Pharmacologie Clinique – AP-HM](https://fr.ap-hm.fr/category/disciplines/pharmacologie-clinique)  \n[4] [PubMed: Spatiotemporal brain complexity quantifies consciousness ...](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41128753/)  \n[5] [eLife Reviewed Preprint: Spatiotemporal brain complexity ...](https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/98920)  \n[6] [eLife: Spatiotemporal brain complexity quantifies consciousness ...](https://elifesciences.org/articles/98920)  \n\n---\n\n## Critical Assessment\n\n- **Strengths**: Strong publication in a leading journal, international and interdisciplinary collaborations, expertise in both clinical and computational neuroscience, and significant grant support.\n- **Limitations**: Limited public academic profile, no evidence of teaching, mentoring, or broader community engagement, and no direct connection to Active Inference literature.\n- **Gaps**: Educational background, detailed CV, teaching roles, and broader professional activities are not publicly available.
