What is your current familiarity with Active Inference?\n2. What is your mathematical/statistical background?\n3. What specific problems or questions are you trying to address?\n4. What is your preferred learning style (theoretical/practical/mixed)?\n5. How much time can you dedicate to learning?\n\nOnce you provide more information about Jan-Eirik, I can develop a fully customized curriculum that aligns with their specific needs and goals.
