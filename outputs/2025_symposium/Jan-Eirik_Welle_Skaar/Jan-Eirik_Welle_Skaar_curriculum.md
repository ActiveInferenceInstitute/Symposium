I notice that several key details about Jan-Eirik are missing from the provided information. To create a truly personalized and effective curriculum, I'll need to understand:

1. Their background (academic/professional experience)
2. Current Active Inference applications/interests
3. Specific learning needs
4. Challenges they're facing
5. Their pragmatic and epistemic goals

Would you be able to provide these details? This information would help me:

- Calibrate the mathematical complexity of the curriculum
- Select relevant domain-specific examples and applications
- Choose appropriate learning formats and pacing
- Identify the most valuable tools and resources
- Design targeted practical exercises

In the meantime, I can suggest a preliminary assessment approach to gather this information:

**Initial Assessment Questions:**
1. What is your current familiarity with Active Inference?
2. What is your mathematical/statistical background?
3. What specific problems or questions are you trying to address?
4. What is your preferred learning style (theoretical/practical/mixed)?
5. How much time can you dedicate to learning?

Once you provide more information about Jan-Eirik, I can develop a fully customized curriculum that aligns with their specific needs and goals. Would you like to share any of these details now?
