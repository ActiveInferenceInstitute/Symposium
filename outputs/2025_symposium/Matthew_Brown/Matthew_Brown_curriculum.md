I notice the background, current Active Inference application, learning needs, challenges, and pragmatic/epistemic values are blank in the prompt. To create a truly personalized curriculum, I'll need these details about Matthew Brown. Could you provide:

1. **Background**: 
- Educational/professional background
- Current field/domain
- Prior experience with related concepts (e.g., Bayesian inference, machine learning)

2. **Current Active Inference Application**:
- How they currently use or plan to use Active Inference
- Specific problems they're trying to solve

3. **Learning Needs**:
- Specific skills they want to develop
- Knowledge areas they want to strengthen

4. **Challenges**:
- Current obstacles in understanding/applying Active Inference
- Time constraints or resource limitations

5. **Value Sought**:
- Pragmatic: Practical outcomes they hope to achieve
- Epistemic: Theoretical understanding they wish to develop

With these details, I can design a curriculum that:
- Builds on their existing knowledge
- Addresses specific gaps
- Aligns with their goals
- Accounts for their constraints
- Delivers their desired practical and theoretical outcomes

Would you please provide these details about Matthew Brown?
