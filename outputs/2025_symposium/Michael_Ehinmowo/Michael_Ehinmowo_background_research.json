  "content": "After an exhaustive search across available academic, professional, and social media platforms, there is **no publicly available detailed information or profile on Michael Ehinmowo related to Active Inference or his stated background in psychology and neuroscience**. Below is a comprehensive summary of findings and research attempts:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Academic Background\n\n- No **educational history**, degrees, institutions, or graduation years linked to Michael Ehinmowo were found in academic databases (Google Scholar, ORCID, ResearchGate) or institutional websites.\n- No institutional profile pages listing Michael Ehinmowo's academic positions or affiliations were located.\n- The only self-reported background information provided is that he has experience in **behavioral neuroscience, psychiatric genetic research, and social psychological research** (from your input), but no external verification or citation for this was found.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Research Contributions\n\n- No **publications or authored papers** by Michael Ehinmowo were found in major academic repositories (Google Scholar, PubMed, ResearchGate, arXiv).\n- No evidence of key publications, citation metrics, or collaborative research networks related to him was located.\n- No recent preprints or working papers linked to Michael Ehinmowo were identified.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Professional Experience\n\n- No LinkedIn profile or professional biography was found.\n- No confirmed employment history, consulting work, or professional affiliations could be located.\n- No leadership roles or patents linked to his name were discovered.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Active Inference & Related Research\n\n- Michael Ehinmowo is **not listed as a speaker or participant** in publicly available materials from recent Applied Active Inference Symposiums (2021 to 2024) or workshops on Active Inference.\n- Conference programs and videos from the Active Inference Institute and related events (such as the 3rd and 4th Applied Active Inference Symposiums) do not mention him as a presenter or collaborator [1][3][4][5].\n- No direct publications or projects connecting him to active inference, free energy principle, or computational neuroscience were found.\n- Adjacent fields such as Bayesian inference, computational neuroscience, or modeling frameworks do not show his involvement.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Academic & Professional Network\n\n- No identifiable key collaborators, co-authors, or research groups associated with Michael Ehinmowo were found.\n- No evidence of conference presentations, workshop participation, or community engagement such as blog posts, tutorials, or code repositories.\n- No social media presence related to research activities was found on Twitter/X, LinkedIn, or ResearchGate.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Online Presence & Resources\n\n- No personal website or research page was found.\n- No Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID, LinkedIn, GitHub, or Twitter/X profiles matching Michael Ehinmowo related to his research background.\n- No institutional profile pages or video/podcast interviews were identified.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Future Potential & Opportunities\n\n- Due to the lack of publicly available information, it is not possible to assess emerging research directions or opportunities in active inference or related fields for Michael Ehinmowo.\n- No evidence to suggest current or potential impact on the field or strategic collaboration opportunities.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- The absence of publicly available information on Michael Ehinmowo in academic and professional databases suggests:\n  - He may be an early-career researcher without a public digital footprint.\n  - He may use a different name in publications or professional contexts.\n  - Or his participation in the Active Inference Symposium or related events is not publicly documented yet.\n- Further information could be requested directly from the Active Inference Institute or from symposium organizers if needed.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n[1] 3rd Applied Active Inference Symposium - YouTube (Program and participant list)  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIemcswLfGg\n\n[2] 6th International Workshop on Active Inference (general workshop info)  \nhttps://iwaiworkshop.github.io\n\n[3] Applied Active Inference Symposium - The Active Inference Institute  \nhttps://www.activeinference.institute/symposium\n\n[4] 3rd Applied Active Inference Symposium Program (Aug 2023)  \nhttps://coda.io/@active-inference-institute/3rd-applied-active-inference-symposium/program-4\n\n[5] 4th Applied Active Inference Symposium (Nov 2024) - YouTube  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCZZBuk_wmU\n\n[6] Active Inference Insights - YouTube  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6ddfMkuSpo\n\n[7] 5th Applied Active Inference Symposium Announcement  \nhttps://lists.cnsorg.org/hyperkitty/list/comp-neuro@lists.cnsorg.org/thread/77K6XOOMWGMRTSYOCY7CQXZBDEPPMJDE/\n\n[8] 4th Applied Active Inference Symposium Playlist  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNm0u2n1IwdpENtnBVYd3qpDyVuV9ePfw\n\n---\n\nIf you can provide additional identifiers such as institutional affiliation, ORCID, or publication titles, a more targeted search may be possible.",
