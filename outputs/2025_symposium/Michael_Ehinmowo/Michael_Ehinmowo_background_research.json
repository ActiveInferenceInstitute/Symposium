  "content": "After an exhaustive search across academic, institutional, professional, and social media platforms, **there is no publicly available detailed information, academic profiles, or publications directly attributable to Michael Ehinmowo** related to Active Inference, psychology, neuroscience, or related fields**.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Research Findings:\n\n1. **Academic Background**\n   - No verifiable records found for degrees, institutions attended, graduation years, or academic profiles (Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID, institutional websites) under the name Michael Ehinmowo.\n   - No institutional faculty page or biography matching his self-reported background in psychology, neuroscience, behavioral neuroscience, psychiatric genetics, or social psychology could be located.\n\n2. **Research Contributions**\n   - No indexed scientific publications, preprints, or conference proceedings authored by Michael Ehinmowo were found in major academic databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, ResearchGate, arXiv).\n   - No citation metrics, h-index, or citation records exist for this name.\n   - No co-author networks or collaborative research groups linked to this individual.\n\n3. **Professional Experience**\n   - No LinkedIn profile or professional CV publicly available that details employment history, consulting, or professional roles.\n   - No records of professional society memberships, leadership roles, patents, or technical reports.\n\n4. **Active Inference & Related Research**\n   - The 5th Applied Active Inference Symposium participant lists and program information available online do not mention Michael Ehinmowo by name.\n   - No presentations, talks, or papers related to Active Inference or computational neuroscience under this name.\n   - Adjacent fields such as free energy principle or Bayesian inference do not show any contributions from this individual.\n\n5. **Academic & Professional Network**\n   - No links to collaborators, conference presentations, workshop participation, or community engagement under this name.\n   - No social media presence related to research (Twitter/X, ResearchGate).\n\n6. **Online Presence & Resources**\n   - No personal website, research page, or institutional profile identified.\n   - No Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID, LinkedIn, GitHub, or Twitter profiles associated with this name in the research context.\n\n7. **Future Potential & Opportunities**\n   - Due to the lack of verifiable academic or professional presence, it is not possible to assess emerging research directions or collaboration opportunities related to Active Inference or neuroscience.\n\n---\n\n### Notes on Search Scope and Limitations\n\n- Searches covered comprehensive academic databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, ResearchGate, arXiv), professional networks (LinkedIn), institutional faculty directories, conference participant lists (including Applied Active Inference Symposium, IWAI Workshop), and social media platforms.\n- The name \"Michael Ehinmowo\" appears to lack public digital footprint in the academic or professional research community based on currently accessible sources.\n- It is possible that this individual is an early-career researcher, a participant with limited public presence, or using alternative names/initials not publicly linked.\n- No ORCID identifier was found, which often consolidates academic outputs.\n- Lack of information on the Applied Active Inference Symposium participant lists or programs suggests either a private attendance or a non-public role.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- To obtain verified information, direct contact with the Active Inference Symposium organizers or the individual for a CV or profile might be necessary.\n- Alternatively, searching specialized institutional repositories or internal conference records (not publicly indexed) may provide data.\n- Monitoring future conference proceedings or publications for this name may reveal emerging contributions.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n- Applied Active Inference Symposium general info and programs (no mention of Michael Ehinmowo): [3](https://www.activeinference.institute/symposium), [4](https://coda.io/@active-inference-institute/3rd-applied-active-inference-symposium/program-4), [5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCZZBuk_wmU)\n- 6th International Workshop on Active Inference details (participant lists absent for this name): [2](https://iwaiworkshop.github.io)\n- General academic publication databases consulted: Google Scholar, PubMed, ResearchGate, arXiv (no results found)\n- Professional networks searched: LinkedIn, ORCID, Twitter (no relevant profiles found)\n- No institutional webpages or public faculty profiles located via standard university and research institute searches\n\n---\n\nIf you have additional information such as an institution, email, or country, further targeted searches might yield results. Otherwise, public data about Michael Ehinmowo as an Active Inference Symposium participant or researcher is currently unavailable.",
