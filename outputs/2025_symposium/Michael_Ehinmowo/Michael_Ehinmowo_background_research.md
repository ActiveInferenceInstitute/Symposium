### Notes on Search Scope and Limitations

- Searches covered comprehensive academic databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, ResearchGate, arXiv), professional networks (LinkedIn), institutional faculty directories, conference participant lists (including Applied Active Inference Symposium, IWAI Workshop), and social media platforms.
- The name "Michael Ehinmowo" appears to lack public digital footprint in the academic or professional research community based on currently accessible sources.
- It is possible that this individual is an early-career researcher, a participant with limited public presence, or using alternative names/initials not publicly linked.
- No ORCID identifier was found, which often consolidates academic outputs.
- Lack of information on the Applied Active Inference Symposium participant lists or programs suggests either a private attendance or a non-public role.

### Recommendations

- To obtain verified information, direct contact with the Active Inference Symposium organizers or the individual for a CV or profile might be necessary.
- Alternatively, searching specialized institutional repositories or internal conference records (not publicly indexed) may provide data.
- Monitoring future conference proceedings or publications for this name may reveal emerging contributions.
