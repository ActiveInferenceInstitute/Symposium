## Active Inference & Related Research

**Direct Connections to Active Inference**  
No publications, presentations, or projects directly related to Active Inference, the free energy principle, or Bayesian inference were found under this name.

**Adjacent Fields and Methodological Overlap**  
The self-reported background in behavioural neuroscience and computational approaches suggests potential methodological overlap with Active Inference, but no explicit work in computational neuroscience, modeling, or simulation was found.

**Potential Applications of Expertise**  
Given expertise in behavioural neuroscience and psychiatric genetics, Michael Ehinmowo could theoretically contribute to Active Inference research in areas such as psychopathology, decision-making, or interoception, but no concrete evidence of such applications exists.

**Research Gaps**  
No specific research gaps addressed by Michael Ehinmowo were identified in the public record.

## Academic & Professional Network

**Key Collaborators**

## Future Potential & Opportunities

**Emerging Research Directions**  
No recent work or public statements indicate specific emerging directions. Theoretical potential exists in applying psychiatric genetics and behavioural neuroscience to Active Inference, but this is speculative without evidence.

**Opportunities for Growth in Active Inference Community**  
Given the interdisciplinary nature of Active Inference, someone with a background in psychology and neuroscience could contribute to modeling psychopathology, decision-making, or interoception within the Active Inference framework, but no evidence of current engagement exists.

**Potential Impact on the Field**  
No evidence of current impact; potential future impact is contingent on demonstrated engagement with Active Inference methodologies and publication record.

**Strategic Collaboration Opportunities**  
No specific collaborators or groups were identified; opportunities would depend on establishing a public research profile.

## Summary of Findings

**No verifiable academic, professional, or research footprint for Michael Ehinmowo was found across major databases, institutional websites, professional networks, or publication repositories.** The only available information is a self-reported background in psychology and neuroscience, with experience in behavioural neuroscience, psychiatric genetic research, and social psychological research. There is no evidence of publications, conference presentations, professional positions, or online profiles under this name.

**All statements above are based on exhaustive searches of Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, institutional websites, arXiv, bioRxiv, and conference proceedings.** Where information is absent, this is explicitly noted.
