Based on Sander Van de Cruys's background in predictive processing/active inference related to aesthetic experience, autism, and affect/motivation, I'll design a specialized curriculum that builds on his existing expertise while opening new applications and deeper theoretical understanding.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Strong foundation in predictive processing and active inference
- Expertise in applying these frameworks to aesthetics and autism
- Published research in affect and motivation
- Likely strong theoretical background but may benefit from computational implementation skills

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Focus Areas:
- Advanced mathematical formalization of aesthetic experience models
- Computational modeling of affective dynamics
- Integration of clinical applications with theoretical frameworks
- Cross-disciplinary applications in art therapy and autism intervention

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
- Advanced Free Energy Principle mathematics
- Hierarchical generative models in aesthetic perception
- Precision-weighting in autism spectrum conditions
- Computational psychiatry frameworks

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
- Implementation of affect-based active inference models
- Development of aesthetic preference prediction tools
- Creation of diagnostic tools using active inference
- Python/MATLAB workshops for model implementation

5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**
- Bayesian mechanics of aesthetic surprise
- Information geometry in perception-action loops
- Mixed-effects modeling for individual differences
- Neural basis of active inference in affect

6. **PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS**
- Design of therapeutic interventions based on active inference
- Development of assessment tools for aesthetic sensitivity
- Creation of predictive processing-based autism interventions
- Integration with existing clinical practices

7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**
- Connection with computational psychiatry networks
- Collaboration opportunities with neuroscience labs
- Integration with art therapy communities
- Conference presentation opportunities

8. **ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION**
- Development of novel theoretical frameworks
- Publication of computational models
- Clinical validation of interventions
- Workshop leadership and knowledge sharing

9. **RESOURCES AND TOOLS**
- Advanced mathematical software (SPM, PyMC3)
- Clinical assessment tools
- Neuroimaging analysis packages
- Active inference modeling libraries

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**
Short-term:
- Develop computational models of aesthetic experience
- Create pilot intervention protocols

Medium-term:
- Validate models with clinical data
- Publish methodology papers

Long-term:
- Establish new therapeutic approaches
- Create standardized assessment tools

This curriculum leverages Dr. Van de Cruys's existing expertise while providing structured pathways for expanding applications and developing new tools and interventions. The focus is on bridging theoretical understanding with practical clinical applications.
