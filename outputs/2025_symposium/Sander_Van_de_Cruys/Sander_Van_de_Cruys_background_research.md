- **Computational Psychiatry of Autism**: Examining the computational underpinnings of autism spectrum disorders[2].
- **Experimental Psycho-Aesthetics**: Exploring the cognitive and emotional mechanisms of aesthetic experience[2].
- **Epistemic Emotions**: Studying emotions related to knowledge and insight, such as curiosity and the “aha” experience[1].
- **Belief Systems**: Analyzing the rationality behind seemingly irrational beliefs, including conspiracy theories[1][5].

**Current and Past Academic Positions**  
- **Current**: Postdoctoral researcher at the Antwerp Social Lab, University of Antwerp[3][4].
- **Previous**: Worked in the Brain & Cognition Unit at KU Leuven (University of Leuven) on the GestaltReVision project[3].
- **Additional Role**: Postdoctoral fellow of the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) at the Laboratory of Experimental Psychology, KU Leuven[2].

## Active Inference & Related Research

**Direct Connections to Active Inference**  
Van de Cruys explicitly frames his research through the predictive processing/active inference perspective, viewing the brain as a “prediction engine” that continuously anticipates and constructs experience[3]. His work on autism, aesthetic experience, and epistemic emotions is grounded in this theoretical framework[1][3].

**Adjacent Fields**  
His research intersects with the free energy principle, Bayesian inference, and computational neuroscience, particularly in the context of psychopathology and aesthetic experience[2][3].

**Methodological Overlap**  
He employs computational modeling and behavioral experiments to test hypotheses derived from active inference and predictive processing theories[3].

**Potential Applications to Active Inference**  
His expertise in modeling the interplay between cognition and emotion, especially in atypical populations (e.g., autism), positions him to contribute to the development of active inference models of psychopathology and everyday cognition[1][3].

**Research Gaps**  
Van de Cruys is well-positioned to address gaps in understanding how predictive processes underpin both typical and atypical emotional and cognitive experiences, and how these processes might be disrupted in mental health conditions[1][3].

## Future Potential & Opportunities

**Emerging Research Directions**  
Recent publications suggest a growing focus on epistemic emotions and the computational basis of belief systems, including conspiracy theories[1][5]. His work on the predictive mind could expand into social cognition, human-technology interaction, and the ethics of AI[3].

**Opportunities for Growth in Active Inference Community**  
Van de Cruys’s expertise in computational modeling of emotion and cognition positions him to bridge gaps between active inference theory and clinical, aesthetic, and social applications[1][3].

**Potential Impact on the Field**  
His research could significantly influence how active inference is applied to understand psychopathology, aesthetic experience, and the dynamics of belief formation[1][3].

**Strategic Collaboration Opportunities**  
Collaboration with computational neuroscientists, clinical researchers, and AI ethicists could further his impact, especially in translational and interdisciplinary projects[3].
