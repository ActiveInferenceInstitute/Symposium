The FWO postdoctoral fellowship is a competitive and prestigious position in Flanders[2].\n\n**Academic Profile Pages**  \n- **University of Antwerp Institutional Profile**: https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/staff/sander-van-de-cruys/[1]\n- **Google Scholar**: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wcZPWOQAAAAJ&hl=en[7]\n- **ORCID**: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4831-7800 (self-reported)\n- **Personal Website**: https://sandervandecruys.be/[3]\n- **PhilPeople Profile**: https://philpeople.org/profiles/sander-van-de-cruys[4]\n\n## Research Contributions\n\n**Key Publications**  \nVan de Cruys has authored or co-authored papers in high-impact journals, with recent work (2021–2024) in *Trends in Cognitive Sciences*, *Personality and Social Psychology Review*, *Journal of Health Communication*, and *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B*[6]. However, specific titles, DOIs, and direct links to full-text articles are not provided in the search results. For a comprehensive list, consult his [Google Scholar profile], which shows a substantial publication record (nearly 3,000 citations)[7].\n\n**Research Focus Areas and Methodologies**  \nHis research employs computational modeling, behavioral experiments, and theoretical integration of predictive processing frameworks to study cognition, emotion, and psychopathology[3]. He is particularly interested in how top-down predictions shape perception, emotion, and belief systems[2][3].\n\n**Citation Metrics**  \n- **Google Scholar**: 2,983 citations, h-index not explicitly listed but likely in the mid-20s based on citation distribution[7].\n- Recent impact is evident from publications in top-tier journals in 2024[6].\n\n**Collaborative Networks**  \nFrequent co-authors and collaborators are not detailed in the available sources. His [Google Scholar profile] would provide this information, but it is not accessible in detail here.\n\n**Recent Preprints and Working Papers**  \nNo preprints on arXiv, bioRxiv, or similar platforms are found in the current search results.\n\n## Professional Experience\n\n**Complete Employment History**  \n- **Current**: Postdoctoral researcher, Antwerp Social Lab, University of Antwerp[3][4].\n- **Previous**: Postdoctoral fellow, Laboratory of Experimental Psychology, KU Leuven[2].\n- **Previous**: Researcher, Brain & Cognition Unit, KU Leuven (GestaltReVision project)[3].\n\n**Industry Experience and Consulting Work**  \nNo evidence of industry experience or consulting work is found in the available sources.\n\n**Professional Affiliations and Society Memberships**  \nNo specific society memberships or professional affiliations are listed.\n\n**Leadership Roles in Professional Organizations**  \nNo leadership roles in professional organizations are documented.\n\n**Patents, Technical Reports, or Applied Work**  \nNo patents, technical reports, or applied work are listed.\n\n## Active Inference & Related Research\n\n**Direct Connections to Active Inference**  \nVan de Cruys explicitly frames his research through the predictive processing/active inference perspective, viewing the brain as a “prediction engine” that continuously anticipates and constructs experience[3]. His work on autism, aesthetic experience, and epistemic emotions is grounded in this theoretical framework[1][3].\n\n**Adjacent Fields**  \nHis research intersects with the free energy principle, Bayesian inference, and computational neuroscience, particularly in the context of psychopathology and aesthetic experience[2][3].\n\n**Methodological Overlap**  \nHe employs computational modeling and behavioral experiments to test hypotheses derived from active inference and predictive processing theories[3].\n\n**Potential Applications to Active Inference**  \nHis expertise in modeling the interplay between cognition and emotion, especially in atypical populations (e.g., autism), positions him to contribute to the development of active inference models of psychopathology and everyday cognition[1][3].\n\n**Research Gaps**  \nVan de Cruys is well-positioned to address gaps in understanding how predictive processes underpin both typical and atypical emotional and cognitive experiences, and how these processes might be disrupted in mental health conditions[1][3].\n\n## Academic & Professional Network\n\n**Key Collaborators**  \nCollaborators are not detailed in the available sources; his [Google Scholar profile] would provide this information[7].\n\n**Conference Presentations**  \nNo specific conference presentations, titles, or years are listed in the search results.\n\n**Workshop Organization or Participation**  \nNo information on workshop organization or participation is available.\n\n**Community Engagement**  \nHe maintains a personal website with blog-style content on predictive processing, cognition, and technology[3].
