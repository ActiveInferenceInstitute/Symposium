## Active Inference & Related Research

**Direct Connections to Active Inference**  
No direct evidence was found linking Kuba Orłowski to Active Inference theory, publications, or projects. His primary focus, closed-loop brain stimulation, is methodologically adjacent to computational neuroscience and real-time Bayesian inference, but no explicit connection to Active Inference or the Free Energy Principle is documented in the available sources[2][3].

**Adjacent Fields and Methodological Overlap**  
Closed-loop brain stimulation involves real-time data acquisition, computational modeling, and feedback control—areas that overlap with Bayesian inference and computational neuroscience[2][3]. These methodologies are foundational to Active Inference, but no direct application or publication in this domain is evident.

**Potential Applications to Active Inference**  
Orłowski’s expertise in real-time neural signal processing and closed-loop control could theoretically be applied to Active Inference frameworks, particularly in developing neurally plausible models of perception and action under uncertainty. However, no published work or project explicitly bridges this gap.

**Research Gaps**  
Given his background, Orłowski is well-positioned to contribute to the integration of closed-loop neural interfaces with Active Inference models, especially in applications requiring real-time adaptive control. However, no current work addresses this intersection, presenting a clear opportunity for future research.

## Future Potential & Opportunities

**Emerging Research Directions**  
Orłowski’s expertise in closed-loop brain stimulation positions him to explore the integration of real-time neural data with Active Inference models, particularly in clinical neuromodulation and brain-computer interfaces. This could bridge the gap between theoretical neuroscience and applied neurotechnology.

**Opportunities in Active Inference Community**  
There is significant potential for Orłowski to contribute to the Active Inference community by applying his skills in real-time signal processing and adaptive control to develop neurally grounded models of perception and action. Collaboration with theorists in Active Inference could yield novel applications in both basic and clinical neuroscience.

**Potential Impact**  
By combining closed-loop neural interfaces with Active Inference frameworks, Orłowski could help advance the development of adaptive, self-organizing neurotechnologies. This would have implications for both understanding brain function and designing next-generation therapeutic devices.

**Strategic Collaboration Opportunities**  
Potential collaborators include researchers in computational neuroscience, Bayesian modeling, and clinical neurotechnology. Joint projects with Active Inference theorists could explore the implementation of these models in real-world neural systems.
