  "content": "## Academic Background\n\n**Degrees, Institutions, Graduation Years**  \nNo explicit information is available regarding Jakub (Kuba) Orłowski’s educational degrees, institutions, or graduation years from the provided sources[1][2][3]. The institutional profile at University College Dublin (UCD) lists him as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow, but does not detail his educational background[1]. No LinkedIn, ResearchGate, or personal website with a CV was found in this search.\n\n**Research Areas and Expertise**  \nKuba Orłowski is a postdoctoral researcher in the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at UCD, specifically with the Neuromuscular Systems Group[1][2]. His primary research focus is on **closed-loop brain stimulation**[2][3]. This area involves real-time monitoring and modulation of neural activity, a key component in both neuromodulation therapies and basic neuroscience research.\n\n**Current and Past Academic Positions**  \n- **Current:** Postdoctoral Research Fellow (Level II), School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College Dublin[1].\n- **Affiliation:** Neuromuscular Systems Group, UCD[2].\nNo information is available about previous academic or research positions.\n\n**Notable Achievements, Awards, Grants, Honors**  \nNo information on awards, grants, or honors is available from the current sources[1][2][3].\n\n**Academic Profile Pages**  \n- **UCD Institutional Profile:** [https://people.ucd.ie/jakub.orlowski](https://people.ucd.ie/jakub.orlowski)[1]\n- **ORCID:** 0000-0002-5380-3275 (profile not directly linked in sources, but the ID is listed on his UCD page)[1]\n- **Google Scholar:** [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ggRcdNwAAAAJ](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ggRcdNwAAAAJ)[3]\n\nNo ResearchGate, LinkedIn, personal website, or other academic profile links were found.\n\n## Research Contributions\n\n**Key Publications**  \nNo specific publications are listed in the provided sources. His Google Scholar profile confirms research activity in \"closed-loop brain stimulation\" but does not list individual papers, titles, journals, or DOIs[3]. No publications are visible on his UCD profile[1]. No preprints on arXiv, bioRxiv, or similar platforms were found.\n\n**Research Focus Areas and Methodologies**  \nOrłowski’s primary focus is **closed-loop brain stimulation**, which typically involves real-time feedback systems for modulating neural activity, often using electrophysiological recordings and computational modeling[2][3]. This area is relevant to both clinical neuromodulation (e.g., for Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy) and basic neuroscience.\n\n**Citation Metrics**  \nNo h-index, citation count, or recent impact metrics are available from the current sources. His Google Scholar profile does not display these statistics publicly[3].\n\n**Collaborative Networks**  \nOrłowski is part of the Neuromuscular Systems Group at UCD, led by Professor Madeleine Lowery[2]. No information is available regarding other frequent co-authors or external collaborations.\n\n**Recent Preprints and Working Papers**  \nNo preprints or working papers were found on arXiv, bioRxiv, or similar platforms.\n\n## Professional Experience\n\n**Employment History**  \n- **Current:** Postdoctoral Research Fellow (Level II), School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College Dublin[1].\nNo details about previous employment, industry experience, consulting work, or non-academic roles are available.\n\n**Professional Affiliations and Society Memberships**  \nNo information is available regarding professional society memberships or affiliations outside UCD.\n\n**Leadership Roles**  \nNo information is available about leadership roles in professional organizations.\n\n**Patents, Technical Reports, or Applied Work**  \nNo information is available about patents, technical reports, or applied industry work.\n\n## Active Inference & Related Research\n\n**Direct Connections to Active Inference**  \nNo direct evidence was found linking Kuba Orłowski to Active Inference theory, publications, or projects. His primary focus, closed-loop brain stimulation, is methodologically adjacent to computational neuroscience and real-time Bayesian inference, but no explicit connection to Active Inference or the Free Energy Principle is documented in the available sources[2][3].\n\n**Adjacent Fields and Methodological Overlap**  \nClosed-loop brain stimulation involves real-time data acquisition, computational modeling, and feedback control—areas that overlap with Bayesian inference and computational neuroscience[2][3]. These methodologies are foundational to Active Inference, but no direct application or publication in this domain is evident.\n\n**Potential Applications to Active Inference**  \nOrłowski’s expertise in real-time neural signal processing and closed-loop control could theoretically be applied to Active Inference frameworks, particularly in developing neurally plausible models of perception and action under uncertainty. However, no published work or project explicitly bridges this gap.\n\n**Research Gaps**  \nGiven his background, Orłowski is well-positioned to contribute to the integration of closed-loop neural interfaces with Active Inference models, especially in applications requiring real-time adaptive control. However, no current work addresses this intersection, presenting a clear opportunity for future research.\n\n## Academic & Professional Network\n\n**Key Collaborators**  \n- **Madeleine Lowery:** Principal Investigator, Neuromuscular Systems Group, UCD[2]. No joint publications are visible in the current search.\nNo other collaborators are listed in the available sources.\n\n**Conference Presentations**  \nNo information is available about conference presentations, workshop participation, or organization.\n\n**Community Engagement**  \nNo blog posts, tutorials, code repositories (GitHub), or other community resources were found.\n\n**Social Media Presence**  \nNo LinkedIn, Twitter/X, ResearchGate, or other social media profiles were found.\n\n## Online Presence & Resources\n\n- **UCD Institutional Profile:** [https://people.ucd.ie/jakub.orlowski](https://people.ucd.ie/jakub.orlowski)[1]\n- **Google Scholar:** [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ggRcdNwAAAAJ](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ggRcdNwAAAAJ)[3]\n- **ORCID:** 0000-0002-5380-3275 (no direct link provided)[1]\n- **No ResearchGate, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter/X, personal website, or other profiles found.**\n\nNo videos, podcasts, or interviews were found.\n\n## Future Potential & Opportunities\n\n**Emerging Research Directions**  \nOrłowski’s expertise in closed-loop brain stimulation positions him to explore the integration of real-time neural data with Active Inference models, particularly in clinical neuromodulation and brain-computer interfaces. This could bridge the gap between theoretical neuroscience and applied neurotechnology.\n\n**Opportunities in Active Inference Community**  \nThere is significant potential for Orłowski to contribute to the Active Inference community by applying his skills in real-time signal processing and adaptive control to develop neurally grounded models of perception and action. Collaboration with theorists in Active Inference could yield novel applications in both basic and clinical neuroscience.\n\n**Potential Impact**  \nBy combining closed-loop neural interfaces with Active Inference frameworks, Orłowski could help advance the development of adaptive, self-organizing neurotechnologies. This would have implications for both understanding brain function and designing next-generation therapeutic devices.\n\n**Strategic Collaboration Opportunities**  \nPotential collaborators include researchers in computational neuroscience, Bayesian modeling, and clinical neurotechnology. Joint projects with Active Inference theorists could explore the implementation of these models in real-world neural systems.\n\n## References\n\n1. **University College Dublin Institutional Profile**  \n   [https://people.ucd.ie/jakub.orlowski](https://people.ucd.ie/jakub.orlowski)\n\n2. **UCD Neuromuscular Systems Group – People**  \n   [https://www.ucd.ie/neuro/people/](https://www.ucd.ie/neuro/people/)\n\n3. **Google Scholar Profile**  \n   [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ggRcdNwAAAAJ](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ggRcdNwAAAAJ)\n\n**Note:**  \nNo additional academic databases, preprint servers, or professional networks yielded further information about Kuba Orłowski.
