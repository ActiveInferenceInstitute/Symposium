I notice that the background information, current Active Inference application, learning needs, challenges, and value sought sections are empty. To create a truly personalized curriculum for Kuba Orłowski, I'll need these details to:

1. Align the curriculum with their specific background and experience level
2. Address their particular challenges and learning needs
3. Focus on relevant applications in their domain
4. Set appropriate pace and depth of technical content
5. Recommend suitable learning resources and tools

Could you please provide:

1. Kuba's professional/academic background
2. Current understanding/application of Active Inference (if any)
3. Specific learning goals and needs
4. Challenges they're facing in learning/applying Active Inference
5. What they hope to achieve (pragmatic value)
6. What they want to understand (epistemic value)

With this information, I can design a curriculum that:
- Matches their current knowledge level
- Addresses their specific challenges
- Focuses on relevant applications
- Provides appropriate learning resources
- Sets realistic timelines and milestones

Would you be able to provide these details so I can create a properly tailored curriculum?
