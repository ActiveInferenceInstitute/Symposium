I notice that several key details about Kuba Orłowski's background, current Active Inference application, learning needs, challenges, and desired values are missing. To create a truly personalized and effective curriculum, I'll need more information about:

1. Their academic/professional background
2. Current understanding of Active Inference (if any)
3. Specific learning needs and goals
4. Particular challenges they're facing
5. What they hope to achieve (pragmatic value)
6. What they want to learn/understand (epistemic value)

Would you please provide these details so I can design a properly tailored curriculum? In the meantime, I can suggest some general approaches we might take depending on their background:

For someone with:
- Technical/mathematical background: Focus on formal mathematical foundations first
- Cognitive science background: Start with theoretical frameworks and biological analogies
- Computer science background: Begin with computational implementations
- Applied/industry background: Emphasize practical applications and case studies

Once you provide more information about Kuba's specific situation, I can:
1. Assess their current level appropriately
2. Design targeted learning modules
3. Select relevant examples and applications
4. Choose appropriate tools and resources
5. Set realistic timelines and milestones
6. Identify the most valuable community connections

Would you please share more details about Kuba's background and goals so I can create a truly personalized curriculum?
