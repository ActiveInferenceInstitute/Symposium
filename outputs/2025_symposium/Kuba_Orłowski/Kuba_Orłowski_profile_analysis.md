I apologize, but I don't see any specific information provided about Kuba Orłowski that would allow me to perform a detailed analysis of their profile. Without having their background information, current work, research interests, and other relevant details, I cannot make accurate assessments or provide specific recommendations.

To provide a meaningful profile analysis, I would need information about:

1. Their academic/professional background
2. Current research interests and work
3. Experience with Active Inference
4. Specific goals for participating in the symposium
5. Technical skills and expertise
6. Current projects or applications
7. Learning objectives
8. Challenges they're facing

If you could provide these details about Kuba Orłowski, I would be happy to conduct a comprehensive profile analysis following the structure you've outlined, including expertise assessment, learning opportunities, research interests alignment, collaboration potential, symposium participation strategy, development roadmap, and Active Inference integration.
