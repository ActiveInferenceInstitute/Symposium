I apologize, but I notice that the profile information provided for Quynh Phan is empty, with no details under any of the categories listed (Background, Pragmatic Value Sought, etc.). Without this baseline information, I cannot perform a comprehensive analysis of their profile.

To provide an accurate and helpful analysis, I would need information about:

1. Their academic/professional background
2. Current work and research interests
3. Experience with Active Inference
4. Specific goals for the symposium
5. Current challenges they're facing
6. Their vision for future applications

If you could provide these details, I would be happy to:
- Assess their expertise level
- Identify relevant learning opportunities
- Analyze research interest alignment
- Suggest collaboration possibilities
- Develop a personalized symposium strategy
- Create a development roadmap
- Recommend Active Inference integration paths

Would you be able to share any additional information about Quynh Phan so I can provide a meaningful analysis?
