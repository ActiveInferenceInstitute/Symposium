  "content": "After exhaustive search across academic databases, institutional websites, and professional networks, there is no publicly available evidence or records that explicitly identify a participant named **\"Quynh, Phan\"** associated with the Active Inference Symposium. The search did not return any academic profiles, publications, or professional information directly linked to this name in the context of Active Inference, computational neuroscience, or related fields.\n\nKey findings and clarifications based on the search:\n\n1. **No Academic Profile or Publications Found for \"Quynh, Phan\"**  \n   - None of the major academic databases (Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID) or conference proceedings contain a profile or publications under the exact name *Quynh Phan* related to Active Inference or adjacent research areas.  \n   - The CV found in source [1] is for **Quynh Nguyen**, an Associate Professor in Epidemiology & Biostatistics at University of Maryland, with research focusing on public health, health education chatbots, environmental health, and epidemiology. This individual does not appear to have publications or research related to Active Inference or computational neuroscience.  \n   - Several conference programs and proceedings from 2023-2025 (sources [2], [3], [4], [6], [7]) list numerous participants and speakers, but no \"Quynh Phan\" is mentioned in active inference or related neural computation sessions.\n\n2. **No ORCID or Institutional Affiliation for \"Quynh, Phan\"**  \n   - The query did not yield any ORCID record for \"Quynh, Phan.\"  \n   - No institutional webpage or professional profile (LinkedIn, ResearchGate) was found that matches this name in relevant fields.\n\n3. **Potential Name Confusion or Incomplete Data**  \n   - It is possible the name is misspelled, incomplete, or that the participant uses a different professional name or initials.  \n   - The only closely related individual is *Quynh Nguyen* (source [1]) who is active in epidemiology and health data science but not in Active Inference research.\n\n4. **Active Inference Research Community Context**  \n   - Active Inference is predominantly researched by neuroscientists, computational modelers, and cognitive scientists affiliated with computational neuroscience groups (e.g., University College London, University of Edinburgh), but no \"Phan Quynh\" or similarly named researcher appears in these circles publicly.\n\n5. **No Media, Social Media, or Code Repositories Found**  \n   - No GitHub, Twitter/X, personal website, or video presentations linked to \"Quynh, Phan\" in the context of Active Inference or computational neuroscience.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- There is **no verifiable academic or professional information available for \"Quynh, Phan\"** as an Active Inference Symposium participant based on current online sources.  \n- The closest match, *Quynh Nguyen*, is an epidemiologist with no known connection to Active Inference.  \n- It is recommended to verify the correct full name, spelling, or affiliation to refine the search further.\n\n---\n\n### If additional or corrected information (such as affiliation or full name) is provided, a renewed search can be conducted.\n\n---\n\n# References\n\n1.
