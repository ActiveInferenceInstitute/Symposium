  "content": "After exhaustive searches across academic databases, professional profiles, publication repositories, social media platforms, and institutional websites, **no publicly available information** was found on a researcher named **Quynh Phan** associated with the Active Inference Symposium or in broader academic and professional contexts related to Active Inference, computational neuroscience, or related fields as of October 2025.\n\n### Summary of Research Findings:\n\n- **Academic Background:** No records of Phan Quynhâ€™s educational qualifications, degrees, or institutional affiliations were found in Google Scholar, ORCID, ResearchGate, LinkedIn, or university websites.\n- **Research Contributions:** No publications, conference presentations, or preprints under the name \"Quynh Phan\" related to Active Inference or adjacent fields such as the free energy principle, Bayesian inference, or computational modeling were identified in major scientific databases including Google Scholar, arXiv, bioRxiv, PubMed, or Semantic Scholar.\n- **Professional Experience:** No employment history, industry consulting roles, or professional memberships linked to this individual were located on LinkedIn, institutional pages, or professional networking sites.\n- **Active Inference & Related Research:** There are no direct or indirect associations found between Quynh Phan and any Active Inference research projects, symposium presentations, or collaborations.\n- **Academic & Professional Network:** No evidence of collaborations, co-authorships, or participation in Active Inference community events under this name.\n- **Online Presence & Resources:** No personal websites, academic profiles, GitHub repositories, or social media accounts related to research were found.\n- **Future Potential & Opportunities:** Without any publicly available prior work or affiliations, potential future research directions or collaborations cannot be assessed.\n\n### Context Notes:\n- The Active Inference Institute and related symposiums list participants and presenters publicly, but **Quynh Phan is not currently listed** in any official programs or speaker rosters available online for recent or upcoming Active Inference events[1][2][3][4].\n- Searches on academic databases and professional networking platforms using various permutations of the name (e.g., Phan Quynh, Q. Phan) did not yield any relevant results in the context of the symposium or Active Inference research.\n- It is possible that Quynh Phan may be an emerging researcher, a non-public participant, or uses a different name professionally, but without additional identifying details (affiliations, ORCID), further verification is not feasible.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations for Further Steps:\n- If you have additional identifying details (institution, email, ORCID), please provide them to enable a more targeted search.\n- Contact the Active Inference Institute or symposium organizers directly for an official participant list or speaker biographies.\n- Monitor upcoming symposium materials or publications for future appearances by this researcher.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n1. 6th International Workshop on Active Inference, official site: https://iwaiworkshop.github.io  \n2. 3rd Applied Active Inference Symposium program and talks: https://coda.io/@active-inference-institute/3rd-applied-active-inference-symposium/program-4  \n3.
