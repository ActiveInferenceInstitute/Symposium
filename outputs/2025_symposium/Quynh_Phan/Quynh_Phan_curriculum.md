I notice that key background information about Quynh Phan is missing from the prompt. To create a truly personalized curriculum, I'll need details about:

1. Their academic/professional background
2. Current understanding and application of Active Inference
3. Specific learning needs and goals
4. Challenges they're facing
5. What practical and theoretical value they're seeking

Would you be able to provide these details? This would help me design a curriculum that:
- Builds on their existing knowledge
- Addresses their specific challenges
- Aligns with their learning style
- Meets their practical needs
- Achieves their desired outcomes

For now, I can outline a flexible framework that we can customize once we have more information:

**Initial Assessment Strategy:**
- Survey of mathematical background
- Evaluation of programming skills
- Assessment of domain knowledge
- Understanding of current AI/ML concepts

**Base Structure:**
1. Foundations Module
2. Technical Skills Development
3. Domain-Specific Applications
4. Practical Implementation
5. Advanced Topics

Would you like to provide the additional information about Quynh so I can create a fully personalized curriculum? This would allow me to:
- Target specific knowledge gaps
- Choose appropriate examples
- Set realistic timelines
- Select relevant tools and resources
- Design suitable projects
