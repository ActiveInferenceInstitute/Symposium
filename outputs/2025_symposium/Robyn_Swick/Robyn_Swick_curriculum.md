Based on the partial information provided, I'll create a curriculum focused on helping Robyn develop educational marketing materials for Active Inference aimed at developers, while considering their work with decentralized Verses models.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Working knowledge of ActInf implementation (Verses)
- Experience with decentralized systems
- Need to assess: depth of mathematical understanding, teaching experience, developer communication skills
- Suggested initial assessment: Create a brief developer-focused explanation of ActInf

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
- Focus on translating technical concepts for developer audiences
- Emphasis on practical implementation examples
- Progressive development of educational content
- Timeline: 6 months for comprehensive program development

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
- Developer-friendly explanations of:
  * Free Energy Principle fundamentals
  * Markov Decision Processes
  * Belief updating and inference
  * Practical implementation patterns
- Creating clear technical documentation

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
- Develop sample code repositories
- Create tutorial notebooks
- Build interactive demonstrations
- Design workshop materials
- Practice explaining concepts to different developer audiences

5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**
- Decentralized Active Inference implementations
- Scaling considerations
