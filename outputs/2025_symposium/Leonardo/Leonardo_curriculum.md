I notice that several key pieces of information about Leonardo are missing from the request. To create a truly personalized and effective curriculum, I'll need details about:

1. Leonardo's background (academic/professional experience, current role)
2. How they're currently applying or planning to apply Active Inference
3. Specific learning needs and goals
4. Current challenges they're facing
5. The pragmatic and epistemic value they're seeking

Could you provide these details? This would help me design a curriculum that:
- Builds on their existing knowledge
- Addresses their specific challenges
- Aligns with their learning goals
- Focuses on relevant applications
- Provides appropriate depth and complexity
- Sets realistic timelines

Once you share these details, I can create a comprehensive, personalized curriculum that:
- Matches their learning style
- Focuses on their domain of application
- Addresses their specific challenges
- Provides relevant examples and exercises
- Sets appropriate progression milestones
- Recommends suitable resources and tools

Would you please provide the missing information about Leonardo?
