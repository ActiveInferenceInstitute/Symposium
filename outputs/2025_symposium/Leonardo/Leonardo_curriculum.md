- **participant**: Leonardo
- **report_type**: curriculum

I notice that the background, current Active Inference application, learning needs, challenges, and values sought are not provided for Leonardo. To create a truly personalized curriculum, I would need these details to tailor the content specifically to his situation.

However, I can provide a framework that we can refine once we have Leonardo's specific information:

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Initial diagnostic survey to determine:
  * Mathematical background (probability theory, calculus, linear algebra)
  * Programming experience
  * Cognitive science/neuroscience knowledge
  * Current understanding of Bayesian inference
  * Familiarity with Free Energy Principle

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
- Foundational track selection based on background:
  * Technical track (math/computing focus)
  * Conceptual track (theory/application focus)
  * Hybrid track (balanced approach)
- Customizable modules based on application domain

[Would you like me to continue developing this framework, or would you prefer to provide Leonardo's specific information first so I can create a truly personalized curriculum? Having details about his:
- Academic/professional background
- Current use/interest in Active Inference
- Specific learning goals
- Current challenges
- Desired practical outcomes
- Knowledge-seeking priorities

Would allow me to design a much more targeted and effective learning path.]

How would you like to proceed?
