  "content": "The search results do not contain any specific information about a participant named **Leonardo** from the Applied Active Inference Symposium, including details on his academic background, research contributions, or online presence. The sources primarily describe the symposium itself, its programs, participants in general, and other named individuals, but no direct mention or profile of a participant named Leonardo is found.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings and Limitations\n\n- The **Applied Active Inference Symposium** is an ongoing event series (2021–2025) featuring multiple participants from diverse domains, but participant lists or profiles do not explicitly include a \"Leonardo\" in the accessible materials ([1][2][3][5][6]).\n- No academic profiles (Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID), publications, professional profiles (LinkedIn), or other resources linked to a \"Leonardo\" related to Active Inference were found in the search results.\n- The search included symposium programs, videos, institutional websites, and social media but yielded no direct matches for the requested research subject.\n- The name \"Leonardo\" without a last name or affiliation is too broad to isolate a specific individual in this specialized research area.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations and Next Steps\n\nTo conduct a **deep and comprehensive research profile** on this participant, the following actions are recommended:\n\n1. **Obtain full name and affiliation:** More identifying details such as last name, institutional affiliation, or ORCID are essential to target academic databases and professional networks effectively.\n\n2. **Direct inquiry with the Active Inference Institute:** Contacting the organizers or accessing participant registries from the Applied Active Inference Symposium might provide official participant lists or speaker biographies.\n\n3. **Search Academic Databases with full name:** Using Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID, and institutional websites with a full name will yield specific academic background, publications, and metrics.\n\n4. **Social Media and Code Repositories:** Once the full identity is known, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter/X, and other platforms can be searched for professional experience, collaborative networks, and community engagement.\n\n---\n\n### Current Status\n\nWithout additional identifying information, a detailed profile for a participant named Leonardo at the Active Inference Symposium cannot be established from the available public sources.\n\n---\n\nIf you can provide a full name, affiliation, or ORCID for Leonardo, I can conduct a more targeted and comprehensive investigation across academic and professional databases.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n1.
