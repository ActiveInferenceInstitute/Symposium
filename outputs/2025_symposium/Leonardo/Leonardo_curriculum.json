Leonardo's background (academic/professional experience, especially in relevant areas like mathematics, computer science, neuroscience, etc.)\n\n2. Their current Active Inference application interests or ongoing work\n\n3. Specific learning needs and goals\n\n4. Current challenges they're facing\n\n5. What practical outcomes they're seeking (pragmatic value)\n\n6. What theoretical understanding they're seeking (epistemic value)\n\nCould you provide these details? Once you do, I can create a highly personalized curriculum that:\n\n- Matches their current knowledge level\n- Addresses specific gaps and challenges\n- Aligns with their learning style and preferences\n- Focuses on their intended applications\n- Provides relevant examples and case studies\n- Sets appropriate pace and progression\n- Recommends specific resources and tools\n- Establishes realistic timelines and milestones\n\nWould you like to provide these details about Leonardo so I can design their personalized curriculum?",
