## 4. Active Inference & Related Research

- **Direct Connections to Active Inference:**
  - No explicit publications titled under "Active Inference" found for Wanjun Lin.
  - However, research in **computational psychiatry**, **dopamine’s role in decision-making**, and **Bayesian models of cognition** aligns closely with active inference frameworks.  
  [Computational Psychiatry publication][1]

- **Adjacent Fields:**
  - Dopaminergic modulation of risky behavior and mood-related decision biases relate strongly to the **free energy principle** and **Bayesian inference** in neuroscience.  
  - Use of computational models of learning and valuation is methodologically overlapping.  
  [Lundbeck Foundation project][2]

- **Methodological Overlap:**
  - Neuroimaging, computational modeling, and neurochemical analysis are key tools compatible with active inference modeling frameworks.  
  [AU profile][3]

- **Potential Applications to Active Inference:**
  - Understanding dopamine’s role in risk and mood disorders can inform active inference models of psychiatric disorders and decision-making.  
  - Lin’s expertise could bridge clinical data with theoretical models in active inference.

- **Research Gaps Lin Could Address:**
  - Empirical neural basis for computational predictions of active inference in mood and risk behavior.  
  - Integration of neurochemical data (dopamine) with hierarchical Bayesian models of brain function.
