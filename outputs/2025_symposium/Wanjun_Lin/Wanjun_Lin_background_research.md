## 4. Active Inference & Related Research

- **Direct Connections to Active Inference:**
  - While not explicitly stated in CV or profiles, Lin’s research in computational psychiatry, decision-making, and dopaminergic basis of behavior aligns closely with active inference frameworks, which model brain function as Bayesian inference under free energy principle.
  - Publications on decision-making and mood-related traits using computational models suggest methodological overlap with active inference paradigms.  
    [Lin & Dolan 2024][1]

- **Related Fields:**
  - Works extensively on Bayesian inference, computational modeling, and neuropsychiatric disorders — key adjacent domains to active inference.
  - Dopaminergic mechanisms studied are core to reinforcement learning and predictive coding models relevant to active inference.  
    [Lundbeck Foundation project][3]

- **Methodological Overlap:**
  - Uses neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and pharmacology combined with computational modeling — approaches often employed in active inference research.  
    [CV][1], [Lundbeck Foundation][3]

- **Potential Applications:**
  - Lin’s dopaminergic risk behavior project could inform active inference models of decision-making under uncertainty and psychiatric pathology.  
    [Lundbeck Foundation][3]

- **Research Gaps:**
  - Positioned to bridge clinical neuroscience with computational frameworks like active inference to elucidate neurochemical bases of decision biases and psychiatric symptoms.
