After an exhaustive and deep web research across academic databases, professional profiles, conference listings, and social media platforms, there appears to be **no publicly available comprehensive academic or professional profile** specifically matching an **Andrew Davis** with specialization in **optimization algorithms and non-linear imaging trajectories** connected to the **Active Inference Symposium** or related fields such as computational neuroscience, Bayesian inference, or the free energy principle.

### Key Findings and Analysis

#### 1. **Academic Background**
- No records were found of an Andrew Davis with publicly available information on degrees, institutions, or graduation dates related to optimization algorithms or non-linear imaging trajectories.
- No institutional profile or ORCID linked to this specialization was found.
- The only Andrew Davis widely visible online is a **keynote speaker and bestselling author focused on AI in marketing and business transformation**, unrelated to optimization algorithms or active inference research [2][1].

#### 2. **Research Contributions**
- There are no identifiable key research publications authored by Andrew Davis in scientific journals related to active inference, optimization algorithms, or non-linear imaging trajectories.
- No Google Scholar or ResearchGate profiles matching this research domain with the name Andrew Davis were found.
- No preprints or working papers on arXiv, bioRxiv, or related repositories attributed to Andrew Davis in these fields were discovered.

#### 3. **Professional Experience**
- There is no verifiable employment history or academic appointments consistent with the stated specialization.
- No professional affiliations or memberships in relevant societies (e.g., IEEE, SIAM, Society for Neuroscience) were found linked to this individual.
- No patents or technical reports associated with Andrew Davis in these fields were identified.

#### 4. **Active Inference & Related Research**
- No direct connection of Andrew Davis to active inference research, projects, or presentations is documented.
- The Active Inference Instituteâ€™s scientific advisory board and event participant lists do not feature Andrew Davis [6][3].
- No publications or materials in computational neuroscience, Bayesian inference, or the free energy principle authored or co-authored by Andrew Davis were found.

#### 5. **Academic & Professional Network**
- No records of key collaborators or joint publications with known active inference or optimization researchers under the name Andrew Davis.
- No conference presentations, workshop participation, or community engagement related to active inference were found.
- No social media profiles associated with relevant research activity.

#### 6. **Online Presence & Resources**
- The notable online presence of Andrew Davis found is for a marketing AI keynote speaker with website [https://www.akadrewdavis.com](https://www.akadrewdavis.com) and social media profiles dedicated to AI in marketing, not scientific research [2].
- No Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID, LinkedIn, or institutional profiles matching the research description were found.

#### 7. **Future Potential & Opportunities**
- Due to the absence of verifiable academic contributions or professional involvement in the specified research area, it is not possible to assess emerging research directions or potential impact on the active inference community.

### Summary

- The **only prominent Andrew Davis online** is a **marketing AI keynote speaker and author** with no apparent connection to the stated research areas or active inference [1][2].
- There is **no publicly accessible academic or professional profile** for an Andrew Davis specializing in optimization algorithms and non-linear imaging trajectories affiliated with active inference research.
- It is possible that this Andrew Davis is an early-career researcher without an online footprint or uses a different name or affiliation, or that the information is not publicly available.
- Alternatively, the participant named Andrew Davis at the Active Inference Symposium might be a less-public-facing researcher or practitioner whose detailed profiles are not indexed or publicly disclosed.

### Recommendations for Further Action

- Contact the Active Inference Symposium organizers or the Active Inference Institute directly for participant lists or participant profiles.
- Request clarification or additional identifying details (institution, email, or ORCID) to refine the search.
- Monitor future publications or conference programs for emerging presence.
