Based on Andrew Davis's background in optimization algorithms and non-linear imaging trajectories, I'll design a personalized Active Inference curriculum that emphasizes practical applications and community engagement.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Strong foundation in mathematical optimization
- Experience with complex systems and feedback loops
- Already implementing Active Inference concepts
- Gaps: Community engagement and collaborative development
- Learning style: Hands-on, application-focused

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
- Focus on advanced applications rather than basics
- Emphasis on collaborative projects and community contribution
- Timeline: 6-month intensive program
- Milestone: Contributing to open-source Active Inference projects

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
- Advanced Free Energy Principle applications
- Markov Decision Processes in optimization
- Variational methods in imaging contexts
- Integration with existing optimization frameworks

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
- Develop Active Inference models for imaging optimization
- Implementation using PyAI and SPM
- Cross-domain application projects
- Integration with existing optimization workflows

5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**
- Meta-learning in Active Inference
- Hierarchical generative models
- Active Inference in continuous spaces
- Novel applications in imaging and optimization

6. **PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS**
- Optimization of imaging trajectories using Active Inference
- Feedback loop optimization
- Real-time system adaptation
- Integration with existing algorithmic frameworks

7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**
- Join Active Inference Institute
- Participate in monthly research seminars
- Contribute to PyAI development
- Present at Active Inference workshops

8. **ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION**
- Monthly project presentations
- Code contributions to community repositories
- Documentation of novel applications
- Peer review of implementations

9. **RESOURCES AND TOOLS**
- Advanced Active Inference papers
- GitHub repositories for collaborative development
- Community Slack/Discord channels
- Academic collaboration platforms

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**
Short-term (1-3 months):
- Join Active Inference communities
- Begin collaborative project
- Document current implementations

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Contribute to open-source tools
- Present work at community events
- Develop novel applications

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Lead collaborative projects
- Publish implementations
- Mentor new community members

This curriculum emphasizes practical application while building community engagement, leveraging Andrew's strong technical background to contribute meaningfully to the field.
