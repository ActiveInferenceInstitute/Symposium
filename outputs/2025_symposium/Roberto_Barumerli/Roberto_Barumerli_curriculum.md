Based on Roberto's background in Bayesian inference and spatial hearing, and his interest in practical applications, I'll design a personalized Active Inference curriculum that leverages his existing knowledge while focusing on practical implementation.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Strong foundation in Bayesian inference (advantage)
- Experience with spatial hearing (domain expertise)
- No prior Active Inference knowledge
- Likely comfortable with mathematical formulations
- Need to bridge from Bayesian to variational approaches

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Weeks 1-2: Foundations
- Connection between Bayesian inference and Active Inference
- Free energy principle basics
- Variational inference fundamentals

Weeks 3-4: Core Framework
- Markov Decision Processes
- Belief updating
- Action selection

Weeks 5-8: Implementation
- Practical coding exercises
- Tool familiarization
- Simple model building

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
Module 1: Bridging Bayesian to Active Inference
- Variational Bayes
- Free Energy Principle
- Generative models

Module 2: Active Inference Fundamentals
- Perception-action loops
- Expected free energy
- Policy selection

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
Practical Exercises:
- Implementation using SPM12
- Python tutorials with PyAI
- Simple spatial hearing models
- Gradient exercises

5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**
- Hierarchical models
- Continuous state-space models
- Applications in auditory processing
- Multi-agent systems

6. **PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS**
Focus Areas:
- Spatial hearing models using Active Inference
- Sensorimotor integration
- Auditory scene analysis
- Practical implementation strategies

7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**
- Join the VERSES Active Inference Community
- Participate in Active Inference Institute workshops
- Connect with spatial hearing researchers using Active Inference
- Attend relevant conferences

8. **ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION**
Milestones:
- Basic model implementation
- Simple spatial hearing model
- Complex hierarchical model
- Integration with existing work

9. **RESOURCES AND TOOLS**
Essential Resources:
- "Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior" by Thomas Parr
- SPM12 tutorials
- PyAI documentation
- Active Inference Lab exercises

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**
Short-term (1-3 months):
- Master basic concepts
- Implement simple models
- Connect with community

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Develop spatial hearing applications
- Create working models
- Begin integration with current work

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Advanced implementation
- Original research
- Community contribution

Specific Recommendations:
1. Start with the mathematical bridge from Bayesian to variational methods
2. Focus on computational implementation early
3. Leverage spatial hearing expertise in model development
4. Connect with researchers combining Active Inference and auditory processing
5. Build progressively complex models

This curriculum emphasizes practical implementation while building on Roberto's existing knowledge base. The focus on tools and resources aligns with his stated learning needs, and the structure allows for immediate application while building deeper theoretical understanding.
