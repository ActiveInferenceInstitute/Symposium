Based on Roberto's background in Bayesian inference and spatial hearing, and his interest in seeing practical applications of Active Inference, I'll design a personalized curriculum that leverages his existing knowledge while focusing on practical implementations.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Strong: Bayesian inference foundations, statistical modeling
- Gaps: Active Inference specific concepts, Free Energy Principle
- Learning style: Likely analytical with preference for mathematical/computational approaches

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Months 1-2: Foundations
- Bridge from Bayesian inference to Active Inference
- Core mathematical framework
- Basic implementations

Months 3-4: Applications
- Spatial hearing models using Active Inference
- Practical implementations
- Tool mastery

Months 5-6: Advanced Integration
- Research applications
- Complex modeling
- Independent project development

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
Module 1: Bridging Concepts
- From Bayes to Active Inference
- Free Energy Principle basics
- Markov Decision Processes

Module 2: Essential Mathematics
- Variational inference
- Generative models
- Message passing algorithms

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
Computational Exercises:
- Start with SPM12 tutorials
- Progress to PyAI implementation
- Develop simple spatial hearing models

Projects:
1. Simple perception model
2. Basic action-perception loop
3. Complex spatial hearing model

5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**
- Hierarchical generative models

7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**
- Join VERSE community
- Participate in Active Inference Institute workshops
- Connect with spatial hearing researchers using Active Inference
- Attend relevant conferences

8. **ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION**
Milestones:
- Basic model implementation (Month 2)
- First spatial hearing application (Month 4)
- Independent project completion (Month 6)

9. **RESOURCES AND TOOLS**
Essential Reading:
- "Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior"
- Key papers by Karl Friston on Active Inference
- Spatial hearing literature incorporating Active Inference

Tools:
- SPM12

- Julia-based implementations
- Custom modeling tools

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

Short-term (1-3 months):
- Master core concepts
- Complete basic implementations
- Develop first simple model

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Apply to spatial hearing
- Develop custom tools
- Complete independent project

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Research integration
- Advanced applications
- Potential publications

Special Recommendations:
1. Focus initially on bridging Bayesian knowledge to Active Inference
2. Emphasize computational implementations
3. Build towards spatial hearing applications
4. Develop practical tools for research application

This curriculum emphasizes practical implementation while building on Roberto's existing knowledge of Bayesian inference. The focus on spatial hearing applications provides immediate relevance to his field while ensuring deep understanding of Active Inference principles.
