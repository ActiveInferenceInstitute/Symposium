Based on Roberto's background in Bayesian inference and spatial hearing, along with his interest in practical applications, I'll design a personalized Active Inference curriculum that leverages his existing knowledge while focusing on practical implementation.

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Strong foundation in Bayesian inference provides excellent starting point
- Spatial hearing background suggests comfort with sensory processing models
- Gap in Active Inference specific concepts and implementations
- Technical background suggests suitability for computational approaches

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Week 1-2: Foundations
- Free Energy Principle basics
- Connection between Bayesian inference and Active Inference
- Basic generative models

Week 3-4: Core Implementation

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

Short-term (1-3 months):
- Master fundamental concepts
- Complete basic implementations
- Develop first spatial hearing model

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Advanced model implementation
- Integration with existing research
- Community engagement

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Original research contribution

This curriculum emphasizes:
1. Building on existing Bayesian knowledge
2. Practical implementation focus
3. Connection to spatial hearing domain
4. Community engagement
5. Portfolio development

Recommended starting point: Begin with PyAI tutorials while studying fundamental concepts, then quickly move to practical implementations related to spatial hearing applications.
