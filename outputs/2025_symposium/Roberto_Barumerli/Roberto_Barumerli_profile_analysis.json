  "content": "Based on the limited information provided, I'll analyze Roberto Barumerli's profile and provide recommendations:\n\n1. **EXPERTISE ASSESSMENT**\n- Novice in Active Inference specifically\n- Strong foundation in Bayesian inference\n- Specialized knowledge in spatial hearing\n- Technical background suggests quantitative/computational skills\n\n2. **LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES**\n- Primary gaps: Active Inference fundamentals and frameworks\n- Recommended learning path:\n  * Start with basic Active Inference theory\n  * Focus on computational implementations\n  * Bridge between Bayesian methods and Active Inference\n- Should explore practical tools and software packages for Active Inference\n\n3. **RESEARCH INTERESTS ALIGNMENT**\n- Natural connection between Bayesian inference and Active Inference\n- Potential applications in:\n  * Auditory processing models\n  * Spatial perception systems\n  * Sensory integration frameworks\n- Could contribute unique perspectives from spatial hearing domain\n\n4. **COLLABORATION POTENTIAL**\n- Could partner with:\n  * Computational neuroscientists\n  * Active Inference theorists\n  * Sensory processing researchers\n- Valuable expertise in spatial hearing could inform Active Inference models\n\n5. **SYMPOSIUM PARTICIPATION STRATEGY**\nPriority focus areas:\n- Introductory sessions on Active Inference\n- Technical workshops on implementation\n- Tutorials on available tools\n- Networking with researchers applying Active Inference to sensory systems\n\n6. **DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP**\nShort-term:\n- Gain foundational understanding\n- Identify specific application areas\n\nMedium-term:\n- Develop initial Active Inference models\n- Apply to spatial hearing research\n\nLong-term:\n- Integrate Active Inference into main research program\n- Contribute to methodological development\n\n7. **ACTIVE INFERENCE INTEGRATION**\n- Natural integration with existing Bayesian framework\n- Potential applications:\n  * Modeling auditory perception\n  * Understanding spatial cognition\n  * Developing computational models of hearing\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Focus on fundamental Active Inference concepts initially\n2. Connect with researchers applying Active Inference to sensory systems\n3. Identify specific tools and resources for implementation\n4. Look for opportunities to bridge spatial hearing and Active Inference\n\nNote: This analysis is based on limited information and makes some assumptions. A more detailed profile would allow for more specific recommendations.",
