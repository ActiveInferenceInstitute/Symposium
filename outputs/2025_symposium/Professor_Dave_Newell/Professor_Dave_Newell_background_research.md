## Active Inference & Related Research

**Direct Connections to Active Inference:**
- **Placebo Research and Top-Down Pain Modulation**: Explores how Active Inference Framework (AIF) explains placebo/nocebo effects[Source: Self-reported background].
- **Therapeutic Encounter Complexity**: Focuses on contextual factors influencing pain perception, aligning with AIF's emphasis on belief modulation[Source: Self-reported background].

**Adjacent Fields:**
- **Bayesian Inference**: Implicitly relevant through the study of belief modulation in therapeutic contexts[Inference based on self-reported background].

**Potential Applications:**
- Integrating AIF with musculoskeletal care to enhance understanding of pain modulation through contextual factors[Inference based on self-reported background].
