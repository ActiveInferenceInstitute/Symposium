  "content": "## Academic Background\n\nProfessor Dave Newell holds a **BSc (Hons) in Biological Sciences**, a **PGCert in Computational Biology**, and a **PhD in Molecular Biology**[1]. His research focuses on **human perception**, **patient reported outcomes measures (PROMs)**, and **tele and digital health**[1]. Currently, he is the **Professor of Integrated Musculoskeletal Care** and **Health Sciences University Doctoral Coordinator**[1].\n\n**Institutional Affiliations:**\n- **Health Sciences University (HSU)**: Current position as Professor and Doctoral Coordinator[1].\n- **University of Southampton**: Visiting Research Fellow in the School of Primary Care and Population Sciences[1].\n\n**Academic Profile Pages:**\n- **ORCID**: [https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1462-3586](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1462-3586)[3].\n- **ResearchGate**: [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dave-Newell-2](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dave-Newell-2)[1].\n- **Institutional Page**: [https://www.hsu.ac.uk/staff/professor-dave-newell/](https://www.hsu.ac.uk/staff/professor-dave-newell/)[1].\n\n## Research Contributions\n\n**Key Publications:**\n- **Lifestyle and Health Behavior Change Support in Traditional Acupuncture**: A mixed-methods survey study on reported practice in the UK[1].\n  - **Full Citation**: J W Pinto, F L Bishop, K Bradbury, D Newell (2022). Lifestyle and health behavior change support in traditional acupuncture: a mixed method survey study of reported practice (UK). *BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies*, 22, 248.
