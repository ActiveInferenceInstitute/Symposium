I apologize, but I do not have enough information about John H. Clippinger to provide a detailed profile analysis as requested. Without more specific background information about his work, research interests, and current involvement with Active Inference, I cannot make accurate assessments or recommendations.

To properly analyze his profile, I would need information about:

- His academic/professional background
- Current research interests and projects
- Published works or contributions to the field
- Specific interests in Active Inference
- Current technical skills and expertise
- Professional goals and objectives
- Prior experience with related concepts/frameworks

If you could provide additional details about John H. Clippinger, I would be happy to conduct a comprehensive profile analysis addressing all the requested categories. This would allow me to make relevant and actionable recommendations for his symposium participation and future engagement with Active Inference.

Would you be able to share more information about his background and current work?
