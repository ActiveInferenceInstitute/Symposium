I notice that several key fields about John H. Clippinger's background and needs are empty in the prompt. To create a truly personalized curriculum, I'll need more information about:

1. His background (academic/professional experience, particularly in related fields like computational neuroscience, machine learning, or cognitive science)
2. His current Active Inference applications or interests
3. Specific learning needs and goals
4. Challenges he's facing
5. What practical (pragmatic) value he hopes to gain
6. What theoretical (epistemic) knowledge he seeks

Would you be able to provide these details? With this information, I can design a curriculum that:
- Builds on his existing knowledge
- Addresses his specific challenges
- Aligns with his learning style
- Focuses on his areas of application
- Meets both his practical and theoretical goals

For now, I can outline a preliminary assessment approach to help gather this information:

**Initial Assessment Questions:**
1. What is your current understanding of Active Inference?
2. What mathematical/computational background do you have?
3. In what context do you plan to apply Active Inference?
4. What specific problems are you trying to solve?
5. What learning formats work best for you?

Once you provide more details about John's background and needs, I can develop a fully customized curriculum following the structure you've outlined.
