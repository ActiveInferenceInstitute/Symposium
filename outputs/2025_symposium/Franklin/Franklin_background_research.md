Generated on: 2025-10-31 15:26:28

## Metadata

- **participant**: Franklin
- **report_type**: background_research

---

After an exhaustive search across institutional, academic, and professional sources, **there is no evidence of an Active Inference Symposium participant named "Franklin" affiliated with Boston Children’s Hospital who has a publicly available detailed academic or research profile in fields related to Active Inference** or computational neuroscience.

The closest and relevant match found is **Kate (Kathleen) Franklin, PhD, CCC-SLP**, who is affiliated with Boston Children's Health Physicians and New York Medical College, working in Speech-Language Pathology with a clinical and academic focus on augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) and child language development[1]. However, there is no indication that she works on Active Inference, Bayesian inference, or computational neuroscience topics traditionally associated with the Active Inference paradigm.

---

### 1. Academic Background

- **Kathleen Franklin, PhD, CCC-SLP** is Chief of Service for the Division of Speech and Language Pathology at Boston Children’s Health Physicians and Associate Professor of Clinical Speech-Language Pathology at New York Medical College[1].
- She completed her doctoral work focusing on augmentative/alternative communication (AAC) for individuals with complex communication disorders[1].
- She has over 25 years of combined academic and clinical experience in speech-language pathology[1].
- No ORCID was found associated with her or any other Franklin at Boston Children’s Hospital in this domain.

### 2. Research Contributions

- Franklin’s research centers on AAC and child language development, not Active Inference[1].
- No publications related to Active Inference, free energy principle, or computational modeling were found under her name.
- No Google Scholar, ResearchGate, or other academic profiles explicitly linking her to Active Inference were identified.
  
### 3. Professional Experience

- Her professional profile highlights clinical education and graduate teaching responsibilities in speech-language pathology[1].
- No evidence of industry consulting or patents related to computational neuroscience or Active Inference.
- Leadership role as Chief of Service for the Division of Speech-Language Pathology at Boston Children’s Health Physicians[1].

### 4. Active Inference & Related Research

- No direct publications, presentations, or projects linking Franklin to Active Inference, Bayesian inference, free energy principle, or computational neuroscience were located.
- Boston Children’s Hospital has extensive research cores and departments, some focused on neuroscience and imaging, but no Franklin associated with these fields[4].
- Other researchers at Boston Children’s (e.g., in radiology and pediatrics) are involved in computational neuroscience, but no Franklin was found among them[2].

### 5. Academic & Professional Network

- No collaborations or co-authorship networks related to Active Inference found for Franklin at Boston Children’s.
- No conference presentations or workshop participation in Active Inference symposiums or related computational neuroscience venues found under her name.
- No public social media or code repositories related to Active Inference.

### 6. Online Presence & Resources

- Institutional page for Kathleen Franklin at Boston Children’s Health Physicians: [link](https://bchp.childrenshospital.org/providers/kathleen-franklin)[1].
- No personal website, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID, GitHub, or LinkedIn profiles identified for a Franklin at Boston Children’s Hospital associated with Active Inference.
- No podcast, video, or interview pertaining to Active Inference.

### 7. Future Potential & Opportunities

- Given her expertise in speech-language pathology and AAC, Franklin’s direct contribution to Active Inference research appears very unlikely.
- Potential interdisciplinary opportunities could exist if clinical communication disorders research intersects with computational neuroscience, but no evidence currently supports this.

---

### Summary

- The **only Franklin affiliated with Boston Children’s Hospital identified is Kathleen (Kate) Franklin, PhD, a speech-language pathologist and clinical academic** with no publicly available research or professional activity related to Active Inference.
- No ORCID or other academic identifiers link any Franklin from Boston Children’s to Active Inference.
- No publications, presentations, or collaborations related to Active Inference were found.
- The search suggests either the participant “Franklin” might be affiliated under a different institution, name variant, or data not publicly available, or the affiliation is incorrect or incomplete.
