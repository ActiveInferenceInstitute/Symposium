  "content": "After an exhaustive search across institutional, academic, and professional sources, **there is no evidence of an Active Inference Symposium participant named \"Franklin\" affiliated with Boston Children’s Hospital who has a publicly available detailed academic or research profile in fields related to Active Inference** or computational neuroscience.\n\nThe closest and relevant match found is **Kate (Kathleen) Franklin, PhD, CCC-SLP**, who is affiliated with Boston Children's Health Physicians and New York Medical College, working in Speech-Language Pathology with a clinical and academic focus on augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) and child language development[1]. However, there is no indication that she works on Active Inference, Bayesian inference, or computational neuroscience topics traditionally associated with the Active Inference paradigm.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Academic Background\n\n- **Kathleen Franklin, PhD, CCC-SLP** is Chief of Service for the Division of Speech and Language Pathology at Boston Children’s Health Physicians and Associate Professor of Clinical Speech-Language Pathology at New York Medical College[1].\n- She completed her doctoral work focusing on augmentative/alternative communication (AAC) for individuals with complex communication disorders[1].\n- She has over 25 years of combined academic and clinical experience in speech-language pathology[1].\n- No ORCID was found associated with her or any other Franklin at Boston Children’s Hospital in this domain.\n\n### 2. Research Contributions\n\n- Franklin’s research centers on AAC and child language development, not Active Inference[1].\n- No publications related to Active Inference, free energy principle, or computational modeling were found under her name.\n- No Google Scholar, ResearchGate, or other academic profiles explicitly linking her to Active Inference were identified.\n  \n### 3. Professional Experience\n\n- Her professional profile highlights clinical education and graduate teaching responsibilities in speech-language pathology[1].\n- No evidence of industry consulting or patents related to computational neuroscience or Active Inference.\n- Leadership role as Chief of Service for the Division of Speech-Language Pathology at Boston Children’s Health Physicians[1].\n\n### 4. Active Inference & Related Research\n\n- No direct publications, presentations, or projects linking Franklin to Active Inference, Bayesian inference, free energy principle, or computational neuroscience were located.\n- Boston Children’s Hospital has extensive research cores and departments, some focused on neuroscience and imaging, but no Franklin associated with these fields[4].\n- Other researchers at Boston Children’s (e.g., in radiology and pediatrics) are involved in computational neuroscience, but no Franklin was found among them[2].\n\n### 5. Academic & Professional Network\n\n- No collaborations or co-authorship networks related to Active Inference found for Franklin at Boston Children’s.\n- No conference presentations or workshop participation in Active Inference symposiums or related computational neuroscience venues found under her name.\n- No public social media or code repositories related to Active Inference.\n\n### 6. Online Presence & Resources\n\n- Institutional page for Kathleen Franklin at Boston Children’s Health Physicians: [link](https://bchp.childrenshospital.org/providers/kathleen-franklin)[1].\n- No personal website, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID, GitHub, or LinkedIn profiles identified for a Franklin at Boston Children’s Hospital associated with Active Inference.\n- No podcast, video, or interview pertaining to Active Inference.\n\n### 7. Future Potential & Opportunities\n\n- Given her expertise in speech-language pathology and AAC, Franklin’s direct contribution to Active Inference research appears very unlikely.\n- Potential interdisciplinary opportunities could exist if clinical communication disorders research intersects with computational neuroscience, but no evidence currently supports this.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- The **only Franklin affiliated with Boston Children’s Hospital identified is Kathleen (Kate) Franklin, PhD, a speech-language pathologist and clinical academic** with no publicly available research or professional activity related to Active Inference.\n- No ORCID or other academic identifiers link any Franklin from Boston Children’s to Active Inference.\n- No publications, presentations, or collaborations related to Active Inference were found.\n- The search suggests either the participant “Franklin” might be affiliated under a different institution, name variant, or data not publicly available, or the affiliation is incorrect or incomplete.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n1.
