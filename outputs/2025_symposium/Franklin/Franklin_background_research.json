  "content": "The search for detailed information about a participant named **Franklin affiliated with Boston Children's Hospital** and involved in an Active Inference Symposium yielded limited direct information specifically linking a \"Franklin\" from Boston Children’s Hospital to active inference research. Here is a comprehensive profile based on available evidence and related findings:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Academic Background\n\n- **Name:** Franklin  \n- **Affiliation:** Boston Children’s Hospital (based on your query) and also linked to Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in research collaborations.  \n- **Educational History:** Not explicitly found in the sources. No direct data on degrees or graduation years for Franklin linked to Boston Children’s Hospital was located in the current search results.  \n- **Research Areas & Expertise:**  \n  - Franklin appears as an author in pharmacoepidemiology and pharmaco-economic research related to clinical trials emulation, associated with Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston[3].  \n  - No explicit mention of Franklin’s direct involvement with neurodevelopment or active inference at Boston Children’s Hospital was found, but Boston Children’s Hospital is a major center for pediatric research, often linked with Harvard Medical School.  \n- **Current and Past Academic Positions:**  \n  - Franklin is affiliated with Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in some capacity, as indicated in publication authorship[3].  \n  - No institutional profile at Boston Children’s Hospital was located under the name Franklin.  \n- **Notable Achievements, Awards, Grants:** No specific mentions found.  \n- **Academic Profile Pages:** No direct Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID, or institutional profile links for this Franklin specifically at Boston Children’s Hospital were found.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Research Contributions\n\n- **Key Publications:**  \n  - Franklin is a co-author in a study on emulating randomized clinical trials using database analyses, published in *JAMA* (2023)[3]. This study pertains to pharmacoepidemiology, involving statistical and computational methods rather than directly on active inference. DOI: 10.1001/jama.2023.15149  \n- **Research Focus & Methodologies:**  \n  - Use of active comparator designs in observational data to emulate randomized clinical trials[3].  \n  - No direct publications linking Franklin to active inference theory or computational neuroscience were found in the searches.  \n- **Citation Metrics:** Not available for this specific Franklin.  \n- **Collaborative Networks:**  \n  - Collaborators include researchers from Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, as well as institutions like McGill University and FDA[3].  \n- **Recent Preprints/Working Papers:** No preprints or bioRxiv/arXiv papers under Franklin at Boston Children’s Hospital were found.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Professional Experience\n\n- **Employment History:**  \n  - Associated with Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School.  \n  - Now working at Optum, Boston, Massachusetts, as per one source[3].  \n- **Industry Experience:**  \n  - Transitioned to Optum, which is a health services and innovation company[3].  \n- **Professional Affiliations:** Not detailed in available search results.  \n- **Leadership Roles:** None found.  \n- **Patents or Applied Work:** No patents or technical reports attributed to Franklin were found.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Active Inference & Related Research\n\n- No direct publications, presentations, or projects explicitly linking Franklin from Boston Children’s Hospital with **active inference** or the **free energy principle** were found in current searches.  \n- Related active inference research at Boston-area institutions involves other researchers (e.g., Lisa Feldman Barrett at Northeastern and Harvard affiliates[4][5]), but Franklin is not linked to these works.  \n- Methodological overlap in clinical trials and computational modeling exists but no explicit connection to active inference frameworks is documented for Franklin.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Academic & Professional Network\n\n- No evidence of Franklin’s participation in active inference-specific conferences or workshops was identified.  \n- Collaborative network includes researchers at Harvard and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in pharmacoepidemiology[3].  \n- No blog posts, tutorials, or code repositories related to Franklin’s work were found.  \n- No social media profiles related explicitly to research in active inference were located.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Online Presence & Resources\n\n- No personal website, Google Scholar profile, ResearchGate, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, or ORCID profiles specifically linked to Franklin at Boston Children’s Hospital were identified in the current search results.  \n- The only identifiable publication for Franklin is linked via *JAMA* and Brigham and Women’s Hospital/Harvard Medical School[3].\n\n---\n\n### 7. Future Potential & Opportunities\n\n- Due to the lack of identifiable active inference-related work by Franklin, future potential within the active inference community is unclear.  \n- Franklin’s expertise in pharmacoepidemiology and clinical trial emulation could complement active inference research if integrated with computational modeling of clinical data.  \n- Opportunities might exist for strategic collaborations bridging clinical data science and active inference modeling but no explicit evidence was found.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- The participant named **Franklin** affiliated with Boston Children’s Hospital appears to be primarily involved in pharmacoepidemiology and clinical trial emulation research affiliated with Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital.  \n- No direct evidence was found linking this Franklin to active inference theory or computational neuroscience, despite the symposium participation.  \n- No detailed academic background, profiles, or extensive publications on active inference were uncovered.  \n- The search suggests the possibility of multiple individuals named Franklin in Boston-area medical research; however, no clear comprehensive profile matching all criteria was found for a Franklin at Boston Children’s Hospital active in active inference research.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n1.
