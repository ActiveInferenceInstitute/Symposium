Transparency in model assumptions\n2. Fairness in belief updating\n3. Accountability in action selection\n4. Privacy considerations\n5. Human oversight requirements\n6. Documentation standards\n7. Regular ethical audits\n8. Bias detection methods\n\nThis curriculum emphasizes:\n- Integration with existing ethical frameworks\n- Development of standardizable approaches\n- Community-driven development\n- Practical implementation guidelines\n- Clear ethical boundaries and considerations\n\nSuccess Metrics:\n1. Development of ethical guidelines\n2. Creation of assessment frameworks\n3. Community engagement levels\n4. Implementation case studies\n5. Standards adoption\n6. Certification framework completion\n\nThe curriculum is designed to leverage Ali's expertise while building new capabilities in Active Inference, with a strong focus on ethical considerations and standardization potential.",
