## Metadata

- **participant**: Robert Small
- **report_type**: background_research

---

After extensive and exhaustive web research across multiple authoritative academic and professional sources, I found no evidence or records linking a participant named **Robert Small** affiliated with the **Black Swan Group** who is involved with the Active Inference Symposium or with any academic or research profile in Active Inference or related computational neuroscience fields. The search results predominantly return information about **Robert Smalls (with an 's')**, a historically significant African American Civil War hero and politician from the 19th century, which is unrelated to the research subject in question.

Key findings and analysis:

---

- No academic records, degrees, or institutional affiliations were found for **Robert Small** associated with Black Swan Group or any scholarly research related to Active Inference.
- The Black Swan Group is a professional negotiation and leadership training organization founded by Chris Voss, a former FBI negotiator, with no apparent connection to academic research or computational neuroscience domains.
- No ORCID, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, or institutional profile for a Robert Small matching the research domain was located.

---

### 2. Research Contributions

- The Black Swan Group is a well-known negotiation training company founded by Chris Voss. It is unrelated to scientific research or the Active Inference community.
- The name "Robert Small" may be easily confused with "Robert Smalls," the 19th-century American Civil War hero, whose detailed biographies appear in search results but are irrelevant here.
- No verifiable information links a Robert Small with the Black Swan Group as an academic or researcher in Active Inference.

### Summary

**There is currently no verifiable evidence that Robert Small affiliated with the Black Swan Group is an academic or research participant in the Active Inference Symposium or associated scientific fields.** The Black Swan Group is primarily a negotiation and leadership training organization without academic research output. The search results for "Robert Small" in this context appear to be absent, and notable confusion arises due to the historically famous Robert Smalls.
