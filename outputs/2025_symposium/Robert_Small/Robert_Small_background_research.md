The search results primarily concern **Robert Smalls (1839–1915)**, the notable African American Civil War hero and Reconstruction-era politician from South Carolina, and do not pertain to any contemporary individual named Robert Small affiliated with the Black Swan Group or active inference research. The historical Robert Smalls was a former slave who commandeered a Confederate ship to freedom, became the first Black captain in the U.S. Navy, and served in the U.S. Congress during Reconstruction[1][2][3][4][5][6]. There is no evidence linking him to the Black Swan Group, active inference, or modern academic research.
