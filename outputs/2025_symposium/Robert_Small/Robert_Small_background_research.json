  "content": "The search results primarily concern **Robert Smalls (1839–1915)**, the notable African American Civil War hero and Reconstruction-era politician from South Carolina, and do not pertain to any contemporary individual named Robert Small affiliated with the Black Swan Group or active inference research. The historical Robert Smalls was a former slave who commandeered a Confederate ship to freedom, became the first Black captain in the U.S. Navy, and served in the U.S. Congress during Reconstruction[1][2][3][4][5][6]. There is no evidence linking him to the Black Swan Group, active inference, or modern academic research.\n\n---\n\n### Clarification and Current Research Status\n\n- **No relevant information was found on a contemporary research participant named Robert Small affiliated with the Black Swan Group in the context of the Active Inference Symposium or related scientific fields.**\n- The Black Swan Group is known as a financial trading and investment firm specializing in volatility trading strategies, not academic research in active inference.\n- The historical Robert Smalls is a distinct figure unrelated to modern scientific research or the active inference community.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings on Robert Smalls (Historical Figure)\n\n| Aspect                         | Details                                                                                                       | Sources                                                                                      |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Identity**                  | Robert Smalls (1839–1915), enslaved African American, Civil War hero, U.S. Navy captain, Reconstruction politician | [1][2][3][4][5][6]                                                                           |\n| **Academic Background**       | No formal academic education; self-taught pilot and leader during Civil War                                   | [1][2][3][6]                                                                                 |\n| **Research Contributions**    | None (historical figure, no scientific publications)                                                          | N/A                                                                                          |\n| **Professional Experience**   | Ship pilot for Confederacy, then Union Navy captain; U.S. Congressman during Reconstruction                   | [1][2][3][4][5][6]                                                                           |\n| **Active Inference Relation** | None                                                                                                          | N/A                                                                                          |\n| **Online Presence**           | Historical biographies and archival records                                                                  | [1][2][3][4][5][6]                                                                           |\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- To locate the **contemporary Robert Small affiliated with the Black Swan Group** and active inference research, more precise identifiers such as an ORCID, institutional affiliation, or publication titles are necessary.\n- Consider searching directly in academic databases (Google Scholar, ResearchGate) or the Black Swan Group’s official website for personnel or research publications.\n- Verify spelling (Small vs. Smalls) and possible alternate names or initials.\n- If this participant is newly active in the field, recent conference proceedings or Active Inference Symposium participant lists might help.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n[1] The Remarkable Life of Robert Smalls - Picturing Black History  \nhttps://picturingblackhistory.org/the-remarkable-life-of-robert-smalls/\n\n[2] Robert Smalls - Wikipedia  \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Smalls\n\n[3] Robert Smalls - U.S. National Park Service  \nhttps://www.nps.gov/people/robert-smalls.htm\n\n[4] Robert Smalls - Life, Civil War & Facts - Biography  \nhttps://www.biography.com/political-figures/robert-smalls\n\n[5] Robert Smalls - University of South Carolina  \nhttps://sc.edu/about/our_history/university_history/presidential_commission/commission_reports/final_report/appendices/appendix-3/smalls-robert/\n\n[6] Robert Smalls | Biography, Accomplishments, & Facts | Britannica  \nhttps://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-Smalls\n\n---\n\nIf you provide additional identifiers or correct the search parameters, I can conduct a new, targeted search.",
