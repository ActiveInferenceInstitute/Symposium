Here's a personalized Active Inference curriculum for Scott David, tailored to his unique background in law, policy, and interdisciplinary sciences:

1. **ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LEVEL**
- Strong interdisciplinary background bridging multiple domains
- Policy-oriented perspective with scientific literacy
- Needs synthesis between theoretical and practical applications
- Learning style appears to favor systems-level thinking and concrete examples
- Gap identified in translating technical concepts to policy/market contexts

2. **PERSONALIZED LEARNING PATH**
Structured in three phases:
- Phase 1: Foundations & Translation (Months 1-2)
- Phase 2: Policy Integration & Applications (Months 3-4)
- Phase 3: Knowledge Capture & Dissemination (Months 5-6)

3. **CORE CONCEPTS MODULES**
- "Active Inference Through Policy Lens"
- "Biological Systems as Policy Models"
- "From Physics to Governance: Scale-Free Principles"
- "Market Dynamics through Active Inference"
- "Memetic Spread of Complex Ideas"

4. **HANDS-ON LEARNING**
- Documentation systems for capturing symposium insights
- Policy framework development using Active Inference principles
- Case study analysis of successful policy implementations
- Knowledge management system development

5. **ADVANCED TOPICS**
- Complex Systems Modeling for Policy
- Cross-Scale Applications (from cellular to social systems)
- Integration of Active Inference with Existing Policy Frameworks
- Market Adoption Patterns and Resistance

6. **PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS**
Focus areas:
- Policy Design Using Active Inference
- Knowledge Capture Methods
- Translation Between Academic and Policy Languages
- Market Implementation Strategies

7. **COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION**
- Active Inference Policy Working Group
- Cross-disciplinary Translation Network
- Academic-Policy Bridge Building
- Market Implementation Partners

8. **ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION**
Deliverables:
- Policy Framework Document
- Knowledge Capture System
- Translation Guide for Different Audiences
- Implementation Case Studies

9. **RESOURCES AND TOOLS**
- AI-powered documentation tools
- Knowledge management systems
- Policy modeling software
- Communication platforms for different audiences

10. **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

Short-term (1-3 months):
- Develop knowledge capture system for symposium
- Create initial translation framework
- Build basic policy application templates

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Implement policy frameworks in test cases
- Develop market adoption strategies
- Create communication materials for different audiences

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Scale successful implementations
- Build persistent knowledge resource
- Establish cross-disciplinary networks

Special Features:
- Focus on bridging pure and applied research
- Emphasis on knowledge capture and translation
- Integration of biological/physical examples with human systems
- Market adoption strategies
- Memetic spread consideration

This curriculum specifically addresses Scott's interest in:
1. Knowledge preservation and documentation
2. Cross-system applications
3. Market and popular adoption
4. Translation between pure and applied contexts

The approach emphasizes practical implementation while maintaining theoretical rigor, with special attention to knowledge capture and translation across different domains and audiences.
