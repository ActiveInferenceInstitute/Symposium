I notice that several key pieces of information about Alisa Sheinkman are missing from the profile. To create a truly personalized and effective curriculum, I'll need details about:

1. Her background (academic/professional experience)
2. Current Active Inference applications she's working on
3. Specific learning needs and goals
4. Challenges she's facing
5. The pragmatic and epistemic value she's seeking

Would you be able to provide these details? Once you do, I can design a curriculum that:

- Builds on her existing knowledge
- Addresses her specific challenges
- Aligns with her learning style
- Focuses on her areas of application
- Meets her pragmatic and epistemic goals

In the meantime, I can suggest some general questions to help assess her current level:

**Initial Assessment Questions:**
1. What is your current understanding of Active Inference?
2. How do you plan to apply Active Inference in your work?
3. What is your mathematical/computational background?
4. What learning formats work best for you?
5. How much time can you dedicate to this learning journey?

Once you provide more information about Alisa, I can create a detailed, personalized curriculum that matches her specific needs and goals.

Would you like to provide these additional details so I can design a more targeted curriculum?
