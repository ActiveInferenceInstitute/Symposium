I notice that several key pieces of information about Arnau Quera are missing from the prompt. To create a truly personalized curriculum, I'll need details about their:

1. Background (academic/professional experience)
2. Current Active Inference applications/interests
3. Specific learning needs
4. Current challenges
5. Pragmatic and epistemic goals

Would you be able to provide these details? This would help me design a curriculum that:

- Matches their current knowledge level
- Addresses their specific challenges
- Aligns with their application interests
- Builds toward their learning goals
- Uses appropriate teaching methods

Once you provide these details, I can create a comprehensive, personalized curriculum that:
- Starts from their current understanding
- Progresses at an appropriate pace
- Focuses on relevant applications
- Addresses their specific challenges
- Helps them achieve their stated goals

Would you please share the missing information about Arnau Quera so I can tailor the curriculum accordingly?
