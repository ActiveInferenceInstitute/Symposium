Among many other helpful resources and tools available online where most of them are free, I found the paper ‘A step-by-step tutorial on active inference’ and your YouTube video of Ryan Smith and Christopher J. Whyte describing the paper very helpful in grasping the basics of active inference.
I also enjoy and find helpful watching interviews (or podcasts) of the researchers of the community where they sometimes express ideas in a more casual fashion than in papers. It often helps in grasping the big picture of active inference notions.",It is my first time participating and I am looking forward to feeling the energy of the people in the community and getting inspired.,To get to know researcher’s personal thoughts and goals which may not be seen in papers.,"My background is in the IT consulting businesses and I have about 10 years of experience in enterprise IT project management work. In recent years, since I met FEP and active inference in 2021, I have been reducing my time working on IT projects (to about less than 6 month a year) and have been spending time studying active inference. In the course of studying active inference as well as shaping my ideas, I have been working on my own paper (which mimics forms of research papers) about a new music app.

 

The paper: ‘Designing a Mobile App to Shape Preferences Using Music Given Perspectives From Active Inference: Music Club App’ (in the Projects section of my LinkedIn Profile) is about combing features of music library and SNS apps to provide people with a tool to build and continuously update their prior preferences using music. The paper attempts to speak in the language of active inference in giving reasons to the features of the mobile app. To provide an outline of the basic concepts and features, I also wrote the paper: ‘An SNS to Explore and Exploit My Favorite Songs’ (also in my LinkedIn Profile).

 

I am also writing FEP and active inference related articles: Lauryn Hill, Karl Friston & Marchia Griffiths on ‘Selfish’ (a LinkedIn article) under the hope to let know the existence and the goodness of FEP, active inference, as well as the researchers of the community to people whom yet to know.","Ideas presented in active inference is so general that it is relevant to everyone. In terms of applying the basic ideas of active inference (e.g., the idea of casting life as model evidencing) to everyone, I think it is required different entry points for different types of people (e.g., non-academic people, non-technical people, children etc.).

Not to mention a platform for me to showcase my journey and contribution.",Being able to appreciate a dialectic engagement of learning and sharing insights and exploring opportunities.,Being open to explore where to apply Active Inference in a transdisciplinary setting. Additionally it would be most pertinent to express dilemmas with peer review in communities at large and how we can be aware of how that impacts peer contribution to areas of study involving active inference.,"Largely what you would call and autodidact although I would say I thank many communities primarily on the internet across servers and social media for enabling me to develop the background I have in cognitive science, mathematics, philosophy... and anything else beyond my failings as a computer science and sociology undergraduate who failed miserably trying to become an engineer... I could go on too much of a tangent from here... If it wasn’t for the internet, I don’t think I would of known about the Active Inference Institute in the first place.

More or less... I am able to find lots of information ranging from academic publications to datasets and other interesting content... along with a non-conventionally developed capacity to build data models and systems models of phenomena and coming up with insights into broad spectrum problems existentially contingent on communities, ecosystems, and humanity at large.","I would say the big technical hurdle is developing a more rigorous derivation of the free energy principle and how it applies to physiological behavior of agents more precisely... developing a kind of psycho/neuro/cognitive based physics paradigm consistent with the standard model and tackling issues with foundations of physics relevant to biophysical insights and insights into agential systems as well as agentic systems.

Another hurdle has to do with recognition for the accomplishments of contributors to the active inference community which may have some indirect association with the problems with peer review.
There are other problems I can’t consider off the top of my head at the very moment but these two are the big ones.",,"Consider the points I made in answering the question “What are the biggest hurdles or challenges facing Active Inference research and application?”
I feel like these are the big hurdles in which maybe we need to make some step by step approaches toward starting from first principles.
In general I feel there are a lot of great publications and content being put out to portray and improve upon the prospects of active inference more broadly.","Working on publishing a series of papers pertaining to the nature of habits and adaptive learning. Habits pertain to persisting behaviors that regulate an agent’s fitness. 

What I have to present to the upcoming symposium is the following...

1. An overview of the nature of habits and adaptive learning and its significance of investigation for active inference... this considers the overview paper I have a nearly complete preprint draft of https://zenodo.org/records/11188526 ... additionally another publication in the works regarding technological interventions considering the nature of habits and adaptive learning which needs a lot of work before having a complete draft https://zenodo.org/records/11188569 ... more recent now I am working on a cross referencing agent-based modeling paper focusing on compositional and game theoretic dynamics of agents pertaining to the nature of habits and adaptive learning
2. Provide an elaboration on the status and prospects of the Neurodivergent Learning Series I hosted... which addresses investigating strategic models of assisted and alternative learning dynamics primarily for those who struggle with neurodivergence or those who want to improve their productivity and learning capabilities.
3. Provide an elaboration on the status and prospects of The Unordinary Bible Study Series I hosted... which investigates the application of active inference and prospect theory considering an unordinary approach to bible study...
