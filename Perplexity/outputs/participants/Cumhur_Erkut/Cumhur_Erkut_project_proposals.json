What are you trying to do?\nDevelop a real-time movement tracking system that utilizes Active Inference (AIF) integrated with edge AI to enhance accuracy and efficiency.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrently, movement tracking systems often rely on traditional machine learning models that may not optimize for real-time processing or efficiently handle uncertainty. These systems can be limited by high latency, inadequate handling of noisy data, and the need for significant computational resources.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project introduces the use of AIF, which allows the system to actively minimize free energy by continuously updating its internal models based on sensory input. Integrating AIF with edge AI enables real-time processing and reduces latency. The use of advanced Python frameworks like JAX, Torch, or TensorFlow will optimize performance.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nSuccess in this project will make a significant difference in various fields such as sports analytics, rehabilitation therapies, and human-computer interaction. It will provide more accurate and real-time tracking, enhancing performance analysis and therapeutic interventions.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\nRisks include the complexity of integrating AIF with edge AI, potential technical challenges in optimizing the system for real-time performance, and the need for accurate calibration of the system to avoid errors.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThe project will require minimal additional costs, primarily focusing on software development and potentially some hardware for edge AI implementation. Estimated costs include:\n- Software licenses and subscriptions: $1,000\n- Hardware for edge AI (if necessary): $2,000\n- Total: $3,000\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\nThis project is expected to take approximately 3-6 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the integration and the availability of resources.\n\n#### 8.
