### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope - Real-Time Movement Tracking Using Active Inference and Edge AI

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a real-time movement tracking system that utilizes Active Inference (AIF) integrated with edge AI to enhance accuracy and efficiency.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, movement tracking systems often rely on traditional machine learning models that may not optimize for real-time processing or efficiently handle uncertainty. These systems can be limited by high latency, inadequate handling of noisy data, and the need for significant computational resources.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project introduces the use of AIF, which allows the system to actively minimize free energy by continuously updating its internal models based on sensory input. Integrating AIF with edge AI enables real-time processing and reduces latency. The use of advanced Python frameworks like JAX, Torch, or TensorFlow will optimize performance.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will make a significant difference in various fields such as sports analytics, rehabilitation therapies, and human-computer interaction. It will provide more accurate and real-time tracking, enhancing performance analysis and therapeutic interventions.

#### 5. What are the risks?
Risks include the complexity of integrating AIF with edge AI, potential technical challenges in optimizing the system for real-time performance, and the need for accurate calibration of the system to avoid errors.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project will require minimal additional costs, primarily focusing on software development and potentially some hardware for edge AI implementation. Estimated costs include:
- Software licenses and subscriptions: $1,000
- Hardware for edge AI (if necessary): $2,000
- Total: $3,000

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 3-6 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the integration and the availability of resources.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Month 1:** Complete the initial setup of the AIF framework and edge AI infrastructure.
  - **Check Point:** Successful integration of AIF with edge AI tools.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope - Active Inference in Therapeutic Interventions for Movement Disorders

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop an Active Inference-based system for therapeutic interventions in movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease or stroke rehabilitation, integrating edge AI for real-time feedback and optimization.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current therapeutic interventions often rely on static models and lack real-time adaptability. These methods can be limited by their inability to dynamically adjust to the patient's changing needs and may not provide immediate feedback.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project applies AIF to create a dynamic and adaptive system that continuously updates its models based on patient feedback. The integration with edge AI enables real-time processing and personalized feedback, enhancing the efficacy of the therapeutic interventions. Advanced Python frameworks will be used to optimize performance.
