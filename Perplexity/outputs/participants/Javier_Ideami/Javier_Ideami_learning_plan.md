### Personalized Learning Plan for Javier Ideami: Active Inference

#### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Syllabus by Jared Tumiel**: Begin with the introductory sections on the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference. This syllabus provides a structured approach, starting with intuitive primers and gradually moving to more technical details[1].
- **David Bloomin's Talk**: Watch the YouTube video "[Deep] Learning Active Inference" to get an initial feel for how Active Inference can be applied using Deep Reinforcement Learning[2].
- **Active Inference Institute Resources**: Explore the website, Twitter, and Discord channels of the Active Inference Institute to get familiar with the community and ongoing research[2].

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the basic principles of the Free Energy Principle.
- Learn how Active Inference differs from deep learning.
- Get an overview of the key concepts and terminology.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Spend 2 hours reviewing the introductory sections of Jared Tumiel's syllabus.
- Watch David Bloomin's talk and take notes on the key concepts and challenges discussed.
- Join the Active Inference Institute's Discord channel and introduce yourself, asking for recommendations on where to start.

#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Bayesian Mathematics**: Delve into the probabilistic computations underlying Active Inference. Use "Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms" by David MacKay as a resource[1].
- **Control Theory**: Understand the control theory aspects of Active Inference. Use resources like "Control Bootcamp" by Steve Brunton[1].
