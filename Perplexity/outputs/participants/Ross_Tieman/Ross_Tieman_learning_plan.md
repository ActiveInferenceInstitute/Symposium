### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)

#### Specific Resources to Start With
- **Mathematical Foundations**:
  - Start with the math section in the Parr et al. Active Inference book, and supplement it with online resources such as the [Active Inference Tutorial](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/Active%20Inference%20Tutorial/) by Karl Friston.
  - Watch introductory videos on YouTube, such as those by the [Active Inference Institute](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4Gn0MglAaA0JZjXy5d1CtQ), to get a visual understanding of the concepts.

#### Initial Learning Objectives
- Understand the basic principles of Active Inference, including variational free energy and expected free energy.
- Familiarize yourself with the mathematical notation and key equations.

#### Concrete Actions to Take
- Set up a dedicated learning schedule (e.g., 2 hours/day, 3 days a week) to go through the introductory materials.
- Join online forums or discussion groups (e.g., the [Active Inference subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ActiveInference/)) to ask questions and engage with the community.
- Start a personal notebook or blog to document your learning journey and note any questions or insights.

### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)

#### Key Concepts to Master
- **Variational Free Energy and Expected Free Energy**:
  - Delve deeper into the mathematical formulation of variational free energy and expected free energy as described in [Active Inference: A Novel Algorithm for Active Learning during Decision-Making Under Uncertainty][4].
- **Generative Models and Bayesian Inference**:
  - Study how Active Inference uses generative models and Bayesian inference to update beliefs, as outlined in [An Active Inference Approach to Modeling Structure Learning][3].

#### Practical Exercises or Projects
- **Simulation Projects**:
  - Use software tools like MATLAB or Python to simulate simple Active Inference models. Start with basic examples such as state-space expansion and reduction.
  - Utilize libraries such as `spm pymc3` for Bayesian modeling and `scipy` for numerical computations.
- **Reading Group Activities**:
  - Continue and expand the reading group at ANU, focusing on specific papers and discussions around Active Inference applications in socio-ecological systems.
