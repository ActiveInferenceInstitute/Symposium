### Structured Learning Plan for Ross Tieman: Active Inference

#### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Mathematical Primer:** Begin with a maths primer or refresher course tailored for researchers from diverse backgrounds. A good starting point could be the "Mathematics for Machine Learning" course on Coursera or edX, which covers essential mathematical concepts relevant to Active Inference[5].
- **Introduction to Active Inference:** Read the introductory sections of "Understanding, Explanation, and Active Inference" by Friston et al. to gain a foundational understanding of the concept[4].

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the basic principles of Active Inference, including perception, action, and the free energy principle.
- Familiarize yourself with the mathematical notation and concepts used in Active Inference.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Enroll in the "Mathematics for Machine Learning" course and complete the first module.
- Read and summarize the key points from "Understanding, Explanation, and Active Inference" by Friston et al.
- Join online forums or discussion groups related to Active Inference to ask initial questions and get a feel for the community.

#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Generative Models:** Understand how generative models are used in Active Inference to make inferences about the world.
- **Free Energy Principle:** Delve deeper into the free energy principle and its role in perception and action.
- **Decision-Making:** Study how Active Inference models decision-making processes, particularly in the context of discrete and continuous state-spaces[3][4].

**Practical Exercises or Projects:**
- **Simulation Exercises:** Use MATLAB routines to build and run simulations of simple Active Inference models, following the step-by-step tutorial provided by the research paper on Active Inference and its application to empirical data[5].
- **T-Maze Task:** Implement and simulate the T-maze task described in "Understanding, Explanation, and Active Inference" to understand decision-making in a controlled environment[4].

**Recommended Study Materials:**
- **Tutorial Papers:** Follow the "A Step-by-Step Tutorial on Active Inference and its Application to Empirical Data" to guide your practical exercises[5].
- **Academic Papers:** Read papers such as "Learning in Hybrid Active Inference Models" to understand advanced concepts like hierarchical hybrid active inference agents[3].

**Community Engagement Opportunities:**
- **Reading Group Participation:** Continue and deepen your involvement in the reading group at ANU, focusing on discussions and applications of Active Inference in socio-ecological resilience.
- **Online Forums and Webinars:** Participate in online forums like Reddit's r/ActiveInference and attend webinars or workshops organized by institutions or research groups focused on Active Inference.

#### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)

**Advanced Topics to Explore:**
- **Hybrid Active Inference Models:** Study the integration of discrete and continuous state-spaces in Active Inference models, including the use of recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS)[3].
- **Applied Active Inference:** Explore how Active Inference can be applied to real-world scenarios, such as socio-ecological resilience, food systems, and disaster response.

**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**
- **Research Projects:** Collaborate with other researchers in the reading group or from other institutions on projects that apply Active Inference to socio-ecological systems.
- **Interdisciplinary Workshops:** Attend and participate in workshops that bring together researchers from various fields to discuss and apply Active Inference.
