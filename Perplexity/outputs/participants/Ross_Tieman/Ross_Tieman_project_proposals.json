  "content": "### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Active Inference Modeling for Simple Socio-Ecological Systems\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\n- Develop and implement a simple Active Inference model to analyze the resilience of a small-scale socio-ecological system, such as a local food network, under different stress scenarios.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\n- Currently, socio-ecological resilience is often analyzed using traditional modeling approaches that do not fully incorporate the dynamic interactions between agents and their environment. These models lack the ability to predict adaptive behaviors and decision-making processes effectively.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\n- This project will apply Active Inference to model the adaptive behaviors of agents within a socio-ecological system. By using the free energy principle, the model will predict how agents perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to maintain system resilience. This approach is new because it integrates the mathematical framework of Active Inference with the practical needs of socio-ecological resilience analysis.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\n- Success in this project will provide a novel tool for researchers and policymakers to predict and enhance the resilience of local food systems and other socio-ecological systems. This can lead to better preparedness and response strategies for catastrophic events.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\n- The primary risk is the technical complexity of implementing Active Inference models, which may require significant time and resources to master. Additionally, there is a risk that the model may not accurately capture the complexities of real-world socio-ecological systems.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\n- The project will primarily require computational resources and software tools such as MATLAB or Python libraries. There may be some costs associated with attending workshops or online courses to enhance technical skills.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\n- This project is expected to take approximately 3-6 months to complete, including the initial learning phase, model development, and testing.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Mid-term Check Points:**\n  - Complete the initial learning phase on Active Inference basics (1 month).\n  - Implement a simple Active Inference model using MATLAB or Python (2 months).\n- **Final Check Points:**\n  - Present the model and its results to the reading group or a research seminar (3 months).\n  - Document the project and submit it for peer review or presentation at a relevant conference (6 months).\n\n### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Hybrid Active Inference for Food System Resilience Under Global Catastrophes\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\n- Develop a hybrid Active Inference model that integrates both discrete and continuous state-spaces to analyze and predict the resilience of global food systems under various catastrophic scenarios.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\n- Current models for food system resilience often lack the ability to handle both discrete decision-making processes (e.g., policy changes) and continuous dynamics (e.g., climate impacts). These models are typically fragmented and do not capture the full complexity of socio-ecological interactions.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\n- This project will use hybrid Active Inference models, combining recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS) with the free energy principle. This approach allows for the modeling of both discrete and continuous state-spaces, enabling a more comprehensive analysis of food system resilience under catastrophic scenarios.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\n- Success in this project will provide a powerful tool for global food security planning, enabling better prediction and preparation for catastrophic events. This can lead to more effective interventions and policies to maintain food production and distribution during crises.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\n- The main risks include the technical challenges of implementing hybrid models, the need for extensive data to validate the model, and the potential for model complexity to overshadow practical applicability.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\n- The project will require significant computational resources, software tools, and potentially some funding for data collection or collaboration with other researchers.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\n- This project is expected to take approximately 6-12 months to complete, including the development of the hybrid model, data collection, testing, and validation.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Mid-term Check Points:**\n  - Develop a basic hybrid Active Inference model framework (3 months).\n  - Collect and preprocess relevant data for model validation (4 months).\n- **Final Check Points:**\n  - Present preliminary results to the research group or at a conference (6 months).\n  - Complete the final model validation and submit the research for peer review (12 months).\n\n### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Integrating Active Inference with Scenario Analysis for Global Catastrophe Preparedness\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\n- Develop an integrated framework that combines Active Inference with scenario analysis and collective intelligence approaches to enhance global preparedness for catastrophic events, focusing on the resilience of critical infrastructure such as food systems.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\n- Current approaches to global catastrophe preparedness often rely on separate methodologies for scenario analysis, collective intelligence, and resilience modeling. These approaches lack a unified framework that integrates adaptive behaviors and decision-making processes effectively.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\n- This project will integrate Active Inference with scenario analysis and collective intelligence, allowing for the dynamic modeling of agent behaviors and decision-making under various catastrophic scenarios. The use of the free energy principle will enable the prediction of adaptive responses and the identification of optimal interventions to maintain system resilience.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\n- Success in this project will revolutionize global catastrophe preparedness by providing a comprehensive and adaptive framework for predicting and enhancing the resilience of critical infrastructure. This can lead to significant improvements in disaster response and recovery strategies.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\n- The primary risks include the complexity of integrating multiple methodologies, the need for extensive collaboration with diverse stakeholders, and the challenge of scaling the model to global scenarios.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\n- The project will require substantial funding for computational resources, software tools, data collection, and collaboration with international researchers and stakeholders.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\n- This project is expected to take approximately 1-2 years to complete, including the development of the integrated framework, data collection, testing, validation, and implementation.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Mid-term Check Points:**\n  - Develop a basic framework integrating Active Inference with scenario analysis (6 months).\n  - Conduct preliminary testing and validation with small-scale scenarios (9 months).\n- **Final Check Points:**\n  - Present the integrated framework and preliminary results at an international conference (12 months).\n  - Complete the final validation and implementation phase with global scenarios and submit the research for peer review (18-24 months).\n\nEach of these proposals leverages Ross Tieman's interdisciplinary background and current research focus, addressing both the technical and practical aspects of Active Inference while contributing to the broader field of socio-ecological resilience and global catastrophe preparedness.",
