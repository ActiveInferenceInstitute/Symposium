### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Active Inference Tutorial and Simulation

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create a comprehensive tutorial and simulation package to help beginners, especially those with applied backgrounds, understand and implement basic Active Inference concepts.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, introductory materials for Active Inference are scattered and often require a strong mathematical background. Existing tutorials and courses may not be tailored for individuals with diverse educational backgrounds, leading to a steep learning curve. The limits include the lack of hands-on, step-by-step guides and the absence of interactive simulations that can help in understanding complex mathematical concepts.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will develop a structured tutorial that starts with the basics of Active Inference, including variational free energy and expected free energy, and gradually moves to more complex topics like state-space expansion and reduction. It will include interactive simulations using MATLAB or Python, allowing learners to experiment and visualize the concepts. The tutorial will be designed in collaboration with the Active Inference community to ensure it meets the needs of a broad audience.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will make Active Inference more accessible to a wider range of researchers and students, particularly those from interdisciplinary backgrounds like Ross Tieman. By providing a clear, step-by-step guide and interactive simulations, it will accelerate the learning process and increase community engagement.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the challenge of simplifying complex mathematical concepts without losing their essence, and ensuring the simulations are robust and user-friendly. There is also a risk of not receiving enough community feedback and support.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project will primarily rely on existing resources and community contributions. Any costs will be related to software licenses (e.g., MATLAB) and potentially some funding for hosting the tutorial online.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take about 1-2 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the simulations and the extent of community involvement.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Weekly Review**: Regular meetings with the project team to review progress and address any challenges.
- **Community Feedback**: Release beta versions of the tutorial and simulations to gather feedback from the Active Inference community.
- **Final Checkpoint**: Complete a pilot run with a group of learners to assess the effectiveness of the tutorial and make necessary adjustments before the final release.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Modeling Socio-Ecological Resilience Using Active Inference

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and apply Active Inference models to understand and predict the resilience of socio-ecological systems, particularly in the context of catastrophic risks such as nuclear winter or solar storms.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, socio-ecological resilience is often modeled using traditional statistical methods or simple dynamical systems. These models lack the complexity and adaptability that Active Inference can offer, particularly in handling uncertainty and non-linear interactions.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will integrate Active Inference with existing research on socio-ecological resilience, using generative models and Bayesian inference to better capture the dynamics and uncertainties of these systems. It will involve:
- **State Exploration and Parameter Exploration**: Using Active Inference to explore different states and parameters of the system to predict resilience.
- **Collaboration**: Working with researchers from ecology, sociology, and economics to ensure the models are grounded in real-world data and scenarios.
- **Case Studies**: Applying the models to specific case studies, such as the impact of nuclear winter on global food systems.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will enhance the predictive capabilities of socio-ecological resilience models, providing more accurate and adaptive tools for policymakers and researchers to mitigate the effects of catastrophic risks. It will also contribute significantly to the integration of Active Inference into interdisciplinary research.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of modeling socio-ecological systems, the challenge of integrating diverse data sources, and the potential for model overfitting or underfitting.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require some funding for data collection, software licenses, and potentially hiring additional research assistants. Estimated costs could range from $10,000 to $50,000 depending on the scope.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take about 3-6 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the models and the extent of collaboration.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Monthly Meetings**: Regular meetings with the research team and collaborators to review progress and address challenges.
- **Interim Reports**: Submit interim reports to funding agencies or project sponsors to ensure alignment with project goals.
- **Final Evaluation**: Conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the models using real-world data and scenarios, and present the findings in a research paper or conference.

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing an Active Inference Framework for Global Catastrophic Risk Analysis

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a comprehensive Active Inference framework for analyzing and mitigating global catastrophic risks, integrating it with existing research at ALLFED and ANU.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current methods for analyzing global catastrophic risks often rely on scenario analysis and traditional modeling techniques that do not fully capture the complexity and uncertainty of these events. These methods lack the adaptive and predictive capabilities that Active Inference can provide.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will:
- **Integrate Active Inference with Existing Models**: Combine Active Inference with existing models of global catastrophic risks to enhance their predictive and adaptive capabilities.
- **Develop Advanced Generative Models**: Use advanced generative models and Bayesian inference to capture the complex interactions and uncertainties involved in global catastrophic risks.
- **Collaborate Across Disciplines**: Work with researchers from various fields to ensure the framework is robust and applicable to a wide range of scenarios.
- **Real-World Applications**: Apply the framework to real-world case studies, such as predicting the impact of solar storms on global food systems.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will significantly enhance the ability to predict and mitigate global catastrophic risks, providing policymakers and researchers with more accurate and adaptive tools. It will make a substantial impact on global resilience and risk mitigation strategies.

#### 5. What are the risks?
