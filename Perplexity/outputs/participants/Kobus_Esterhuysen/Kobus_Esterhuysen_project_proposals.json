  "content": "### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Dynamic Trading Using Active Inference\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nDevelop and implement an Active Inference (AIF) model for dynamic trading in financial markets to optimize trading decisions and reduce risks.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrently, dynamic trading often relies on traditional machine learning models or rule-based systems, which can be limited by their lack of adaptability to changing market conditions and their inability to integrate both perception and action in a unified framework. These methods often require extensive manual tuning and may not capture the full complexity of market dynamics.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project will use the RxInfer.jl package to implement an AIF model that integrates predictive coding and hierarchical internal models to make adaptive trading decisions. The AIF approach will allow the model to learn from market data, predict future trends, and optimize trading policies in real-time, leveraging the theoretical underpinnings of AIF to unify perception and action.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nSuccess in this project will provide a more robust and adaptive trading system that can outperform traditional models, reducing financial risks and improving trading outcomes. This will be particularly valuable for financial institutions and individual traders looking to enhance their trading strategies.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\nRisks include the complexity of implementing AIF models, the need for high-quality market data, and the potential for overfitting or underfitting the model. Additionally, there is a risk that the model may not generalize well to unseen market conditions.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThe primary cost will be time and computational resources. Since the project leverages the open-source RxInfer.jl package, there are no significant software costs.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\nThis project is expected to take 1-2 months to complete, given the participant's existing familiarity with RxInfer.jl and AIF concepts.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Mid-term Check Point (1 month):** Complete the initial implementation of the AIF model using RxInfer.jl and test it on historical market data.\n- **Final Check Point (2 months):** Evaluate the model's performance on real-time market data and compare it with traditional trading models.\n\n**Potential Collaborators or Resources:**\n- Join the RxInfer.jl learning and development group on Discord for community support.\n- Utilize resources from the Active Inference Institute, such as the EduActive unit projects.\n- Collaborate with financial analysts or institutions to access high-quality market data.\n\n### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with Reinforcement Learning for Inventory Management\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nDevelop an integrated system that combines Active Inference (AIF) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize inventory management in retail or manufacturing settings.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrent inventory management systems often use either traditional optimization techniques or simple RL models. These approaches can be limited by their inability to handle complex, dynamic environments and their lack of integration with higher-level cognitive processes.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project will integrate AIF's predictive coding and hierarchical internal models with RL's policy optimization to create a more adaptive and robust inventory management system. The AIF component will predict demand and supply dynamics, while the RL component will optimize the inventory policies based on these predictions.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nSuccess in this project will provide a more efficient and adaptive inventory management system, reducing stockouts, overstocking, and associated costs. This will be valuable for retailers and manufacturers looking to optimize their supply chain operations.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\nRisks include the complexity of integrating AIF and RL, the need for extensive data on inventory dynamics, and the potential for the model to be overly complex or difficult to interpret.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThe primary costs will be time, computational resources, and potentially accessing industry data. There may also be costs associated with collaborating with industry partners.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\nThis project is expected to take 3-6 months to complete, considering the need to develop and test the integrated AIF-RL model.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Mid-term Check Point (3 months):** Complete the initial integration of AIF and RL components and test the system on simulated inventory data.\n- **Final Check Point (6 months):** Evaluate the system's performance on real-world inventory data and compare it with existing inventory management systems.\n\n**Potential Collaborators or Resources:**\n- Collaborate with researchers like Tetsuya Ogata on embodied AI and deep active inference agents.\n- Engage with industry partners in retail or manufacturing to access real-world inventory data.\n- Utilize resources from the Active Inference Institute, such as the ReInference unit research.\n\n### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing Embodied Active Inference Agents for Robotics\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nDevelop embodied Active Inference (AIF) agents for robotics that can adaptively interact with and learn from their environment, integrating perception, action, and cognition in a unified framework.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrent robotic systems often use separate modules for perception, action, and cognition, which can lead to inefficiencies and a lack of adaptability in complex environments. Existing approaches may not fully integrate the robot's sensory and motor capabilities with higher-level cognitive processes.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project will leverage AIF to create embodied agents that use predictive coding and hierarchical internal models to integrate sensory input, motor actions, and cognitive processes. The agents will learn to navigate and interact with their environment through active inference, optimizing their policies to minimize free energy.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nSuccess in this project will lead to the development of highly adaptive and autonomous robotic systems that can perform complex tasks in dynamic environments, such as search and rescue, manufacturing, or home assistance. This will be valuable for industries and applications requiring advanced robotics.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\nRisks include the high complexity of developing embodied AIF agents, the need for extensive testing and validation, and potential challenges in scaling the models to real-world scenarios.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThe costs will include significant time, computational resources, and potentially hardware costs for robotic systems. There may also be costs associated with collaborating with robotics researchers and industry partners.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\nThis project is expected to take 6-12 months to complete, considering the complexity of developing and testing embodied AIF agents.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Mid-term Check Point (6 months):** Complete the initial development of the embodied AIF agent and test it in a simulated environment.\n- **Final Check Point (12 months):** Evaluate the agent's performance in real-world robotic tasks and compare it with existing robotic systems.\n\n**Potential Collaborators or Resources:**\n- Collaborate with researchers like Tetsuya Ogata on embodied AI and deep active inference agents.\n- Engage with robotics researchers and industry partners to access real-world robotic systems and data.\n- Utilize resources from the Active Inference Institute, such as the EduActive unit projects and ReInference unit research.\n- Participate in workshops and conferences focused on AIF and robotics to network and learn from other researchers.",
