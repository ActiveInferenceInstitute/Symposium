### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Active Inference in Inventory Management

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Objective: Develop and implement an Active Inference (AIF) model to optimize inventory management in a retail setting, ensuring the right stock levels and minimizing overstocking or understocking.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current inventory management often relies on traditional statistical methods or simple machine learning models that do not account for dynamic changes in demand or supply. These methods can lead to inefficiencies, such as overstocking or stockouts, and fail to adapt to new information.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will apply Active Inference to inventory management by using Bayesian inference and generative models to predict demand and optimize stock levels. The approach will incorporate the free energy principle to minimize prediction errors and make optimal decisions. The use of RxInfer.jl and the Powell Unified Framework will enable robust and adaptive decision-making.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will improve inventory management efficiency, reducing costs associated with overstocking and stockouts. It will also enhance the retailer's ability to respond to changing market conditions, leading to better customer satisfaction and increased profitability.

#### 5. What are the risks?
Risks include the complexity of implementing AIF in a real-world setting, potential data quality issues, and the need for continuous model updating to reflect changing market conditions.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project will primarily involve time and computational resources. Estimated costs include:
- Software and computational resources: Minimal, as RxInfer.jl is open-source.
- Time: Approximately 2-3 months of part-time work.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take around 2-3 months to complete, with the following milestones:
- Week 1-2: Literature review and setting up the RxInfer.jl environment.
- Week 3-6: Developing and testing the AIF model.
- Week 7-12: Implementing and refining the model in a real-world setting.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint**: Successfully develop and test the AIF model in a simulated environment (Week 6).
- **Final Checkpoint**: Implement and evaluate the model in a real retail setting, measuring its impact on inventory management efficiency (Week 12).

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Dynamic Trading Using Active Inference

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Objective: Develop an Active Inference framework to optimize dynamic trading strategies in financial markets, leveraging Bayesian inference and generative models to predict market movements and make informed trading decisions.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current trading strategies often rely on traditional machine learning models or rule-based systems that do not fully account for the dynamic and uncertain nature of financial markets. These methods can be inflexible and fail to adapt quickly to new market conditions.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will apply Active Inference to dynamic trading by using the free energy principle to minimize prediction errors and optimize trading decisions. The approach will integrate RxInfer.jl and the Powell Unified Framework to handle sequential decision-making under uncertainty. The use of scale-free Active Inference will allow for adaptive and flexible trading strategies.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will enhance the ability of traders and financial institutions to make informed, adaptive decisions in dynamic markets, potentially leading to increased profitability and reduced risk.

#### 5. What are the risks?
Risks include the complexity of financial data, the need for high-quality and real-time data feeds, and the potential for overfitting or underfitting the AIF model.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
Estimated costs include:
- Software and computational resources: Moderate, depending on the scale of data processing.
- Time: Approximately 6 months of part-time work.
- Data feeds and market access: Depending on the source and quality of data.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take around 6 months to complete, with the following milestones:
- Month 1-2: Literature review, setting up the environment, and data collection.
- Month 3-4: Developing and testing the AIF model.
- Month 5-6: Implementing and refining the model in a real-world trading scenario.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint**: Successfully develop and test the AIF model in a simulated trading environment (Month 4).
- **Final Checkpoint**: Implement and evaluate the model in a real trading setting, measuring its impact on trading performance (Month 6).

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Embodied Active Inference in Autonomous Systems

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Objective: Develop an embodied Active Inference framework for autonomous systems, integrating sensorimotor skills and social interactions to create adaptive and intelligent autonomous agents.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current autonomous systems often rely on traditional control theories or machine learning models that do not fully integrate sensory information with motor actions and social context. These systems can be rigid and fail to adapt to complex, dynamic environments.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will apply embodied Active Inference by using generative models and the free energy principle to integrate sensory information, motor actions, and social interactions. The approach will leverage RxInfer.jl and other relevant tools to create adaptive and flexible autonomous agents. The use of renormalising generative models (RGM) will enable scale-free Active Inference, allowing the agents to operate effectively in dynamic and uncertain environments.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will lead to the development of highly adaptive and intelligent autonomous systems that can interact effectively with their environment and other agents, potentially transforming industries such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare.

#### 5. What are the risks?
Risks include the complexity of integrating multiple sensory and motor systems, the need for high-quality and diverse data, and the potential ethical implications of creating highly autonomous systems.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
Estimated costs include:
- Software and computational resources: Significant, depending on the scale and complexity of the project.
- Time: Approximately 1-2 years of full-time work.
- Data collection and experimental setup: Depending on the scope and complexity.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take around 1-2 years to complete, with the following milestones:
- Month 1-6: Literature review, setting up the environment, and initial model development.
- Month 7-12: Testing and refining the model in simulated environments.
- Month 13-24: Implementing and evaluating the model in real-world scenarios.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint**: Successfully develop and test the embodied AIF model in simulated environments (Month 12).
- **Final Checkpoint**: Implement and evaluate the model in real-world autonomous systems, measuring its impact on autonomy and adaptability (Month 24).
