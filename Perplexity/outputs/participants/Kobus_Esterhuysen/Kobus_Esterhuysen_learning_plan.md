### Personalized Learning Plan for Kobus Esterhuysen on Active Inference

#### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Active Inference Institute Newsletter and Projects**: Start by reviewing the June 2024 Newsletter from the Active Inference Institute to get updated on the latest developments, projects, and community activities. Focus on the EduActive unit and ReInference unit reports[5].
- **RxInfer.jl Learning and Development Group**: Join the RxInfer.jl learning and development group on Discord to engage with the community and contribute to the open-source package. This will provide hands-on experience and access to practical examples[5].

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the current state of Active Inference applications and research.
- Familiarize yourself with the RxInfer.jl package and its community.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Register for the upcoming Cohort 7 or continue with Cohort 6 of the Active Inference Institute's educational programs to gain structured learning and informal Math Group sessions[5].
- Participate in the weekly meetings of the RxInfer.jl learning and development group.
- Review Kobus Esterhuysen's own projects on `learnableloop.com` and `learnableloop.ai` to reinforce his existing knowledge and identify areas for expansion[2].

#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Predictive Coding Models**: Delve deeper into predictive coding models and their application in various domains.
- **Hierarchical Internal Models**: Understand how hierarchical internal models are used in Active Inference.
- **Policy Optimization**: Learn about policy optimization techniques within the Active Inference framework.

**Practical Exercises or Projects:**
- **Dynamic Trading using Active Inference**: Implement the Dynamic Trading project using RxInfer to apply Active Inference in a financial context[1].
- **Bayesian Regression with RxInfer**: Use RxInfer to perform Bayesian regression in a medical or retail context, as demonstrated in Kobus Esterhuysen's projects[2].

**Recommended Study Materials:**
- **Sanjeev Namjoshi's Textbook Draft**: Engage with the draft of Sanjeev Namjoshi's upcoming textbook on Active Inference, which is expected to provide a comprehensive overview of the field[5].
- **Academic Papers**: Read papers such as "From pixels to planning: scale-free active inference" to understand the latest developments in Active Inference, including generative modeling and hierarchical forms[3].

**Community Engagement Opportunities:**
- **Participate in Livestreams and GuestStreams**: Attend livestreams and guest streams organized by the Active Inference Institute, such as "Active Data Sampling" and "The Nature of Habits and Agential Systems"[5].
- **Join Forums and Discussions**: Engage in forums and discussion groups within the Active Inference community to share knowledge and learn from others.

#### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)

**Advanced Topics to Explore:**
- **Embodied AI and Deep Active Inference Agents**: Collaborate with researchers like Tetsuya Ogata to explore embodied AI and deep active inference agents, focusing on complex, continuous state-spaces[5].
- **Cognitive Map Learning and Planning**: Work with Toon Van de Maele and others on integrating cognitive map learning and Active Inference for planning in ambiguous environments[5].

**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**
- **Collaborative Research Projects**: Engage in collaborative research projects within the AIF community, such as those focused on social sciences ontologies for health and disease, or negotiation affordances in collective foraging[5].
- **Industry Applications**: Collaborate with industry partners to apply Active Inference in finance, business processes, robotics, or other relevant domains.

**Application Projects in Their Domain:**
- **Finance and Business Processes**: Develop and implement Active Inference models for dynamic trading, inventory management, or other financial and business applications.
- **Reinforcement Learning Integration**: Integrate Active Inference with Reinforcement Learning techniques, such as DDPG or DQN, to enhance decision-making processes in various domains[2].

**Skill-Building Activities:**
- **Julia Programming**: Enhance skills in Julia programming by working on RxInfer.jl projects and contributing to the open-source package.
