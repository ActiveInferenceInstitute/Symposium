### Personalized Learning Plan for Kobus Esterhuysen on Active Inference

#### Immediate Next Steps (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Active Inference Institute Newsletter and Projects**: Start by reviewing the June 2024 Newsletter from the Active Inference Institute to understand current projects and developments, such as the EduActive unit and the ReInference unit[5].
- **Fundamentals of Active Inference**: Engage with the draft of Sanjeev Namjoshi's upcoming textbook on Active Inference, which is expected to provide a comprehensive introduction to the subject[5].

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles of Active Inference, including Bayesian inference, generative models, and the free energy principle.
- Familiarize yourself with recent applications and projects in the field.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Register for the upcoming Cohort 7 of the EduActive unit, which includes additional informal Math Group sessions and RxInfer.jl usage[5].
- Review the key concepts of Active Inference as outlined in the MDPI article, focusing on Bayesian inference, generative models, and the role of free energy[2].

#### Short-Term Goals (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Bayesian Inference and Generative Models**: Delve deeper into the mathematical foundations of Bayesian inference and how it is applied in Active Inference to update beliefs and make predictions[2].
- **Variational Free Energy and Expected Free Energy**: Understand how these concepts are used to minimize prediction errors and make optimal decisions[2].
- **Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)**: Learn how POMDPs are used in Active Inference to model decision-making with partial information[2].

**Practical Exercises or Projects:**
- **RxInfer.jl Tutorials**: Participate in the RxInfer.jl learning and development group to gain hands-on experience with the RxInfer.jl package. This involves weekly meetings and contributing to the open-source package[5].
- **T-maze Active Inference Project**: Engage with the T-maze Active Inference project to understand policy inference and how Active Inference is applied in a controlled environment[3].

**Recommended Study Materials:**
- **Textbook Draft by Sanjeev Namjoshi**: Continue working through the draft of Namjoshi's textbook to solidify your understanding of Active Inference fundamentals[5].
- **MDPI Article on Active Inference**: Use the MDPI article as a comprehensive resource to understand the key features and benefits of Active Inference[2].
- **Active Inference Institute Livestreams**: Watch relevant livestreams from the Active Inference Institute, such as "Active Data Sampling" and "The Nature of Habits and Agential Systems"[5].

**Community Engagement Opportunities:**
- **Join the Active Inference Institute Community**: Participate in the community discussions, especially the #engineering channel in Discord, to engage with other researchers and practitioners working on RxInfer.jl and other Active Inference projects[5].
- **Collaborate on Projects**: Look for opportunities to collaborate with other participants and presenters, such as Susan Hasty's work on Action Research on Collective Foraging, to share experiences and insights[5].

#### Medium-Term Development (3-6 months)

**Advanced Topics to Explore:**
- **Scale-Free Active Inference**: Study the paper on "From pixels to planning: scale-free active inference" to understand how Active Inference can be applied in dynamic settings using renormalising generative models (RGM)[1].
- **Embodied and Situated Learning**: Explore the application of Active Inference in embodied neuromorphic agents, focusing on learning mechanisms, sensorimotor skills, and social interactions[2].

**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**
- **Interdisciplinary Projects**: Collaborate on projects that require both technical sophistication and business acumen, such as applying Active Inference in finance or business processes.
- **Industry Case Studies**: Work with other researchers to develop and share industry case studies and whitepapers on AIF applications, which can help in addressing the lack of practical examples.

**Application Projects in Their Domain:**
- **Dynamic Trading Using Active Inference**: Apply Active Inference to dynamic trading scenarios, using tools like RxInfer and the Powell Unified Framework, to find optimal times to buy and sell assets[3].
- **Inventory Management**: Use Active Inference for inventory management in various industries, such as retail or automotive, to optimize decision-making processes[3].

**Skill-Building Activities:**
- **Math Group Sessions**: Attend the informal Math Group sessions provided by the EduActive unit to deepen your mathematical understanding of Active Inference[5].
- **Software Tools and Frameworks**: Gain proficiency in using RxInfer.jl and other relevant software tools by contributing to open-source projects and participating in community development efforts[5].
