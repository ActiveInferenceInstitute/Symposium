Focus on the EduActive unit and ReInference unit reports[5].\n- **RxInfer.jl Learning and Development Group**: Join the RxInfer.jl learning and development group on Discord to engage with the community and contribute to the open-source package. This will provide hands-on experience and access to practical examples[5].\n\n**Initial Learning Objectives:**\n- Understand the current state of Active Inference applications and research.\n- Familiarize yourself with the RxInfer.jl package and its community.\n\n**Concrete Actions to Take:**\n- Register for the upcoming Cohort 7 or continue with Cohort 6 of the Active Inference Institute's educational programs to gain structured learning and informal Math Group sessions[5].\n- Participate in the weekly meetings of the RxInfer.jl learning and development group.\n- Review Kobus Esterhuysen's own projects on `learnableloop.com` and `learnableloop.ai` to reinforce his existing knowledge and identify areas for expansion[2].\n\n#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)\n\n**Key Concepts to Master:**\n- **Predictive Coding Models**: Delve deeper into predictive coding models and their application in various domains.\n- **Hierarchical Internal Models**: Understand how hierarchical internal models are used in Active Inference.\n- **Policy Optimization**: Learn about policy optimization techniques within the Active Inference framework.\n\n**Practical Exercises or Projects:**\n- **Dynamic Trading using Active Inference**: Implement the Dynamic Trading project using RxInfer to apply Active Inference in a financial context[1].\n- **Bayesian Regression with RxInfer**: Use RxInfer to perform Bayesian regression in a medical or retail context, as demonstrated in Kobus Esterhuysen's projects[2].\n\n**Recommended Study Materials:**\n- **Sanjeev Namjoshi's Textbook Draft**: Engage with the draft of Sanjeev Namjoshi's upcoming textbook on Active Inference, which is expected to provide a comprehensive overview of the field[5].\n- **Academic Papers**: Read papers such as \"From pixels to planning: scale-free active inference\" to understand the latest developments in Active Inference, including generative modeling and hierarchical forms[3].\n\n**Community Engagement Opportunities:**\n- **Participate in Livestreams and GuestStreams**: Attend livestreams and guest streams organized by the Active Inference Institute, such as \"Active Data Sampling\" and \"The Nature of Habits and Agential Systems\"[5].\n- **Join Forums and Discussions**: Engage in forums and discussion groups within the Active Inference community to share knowledge and learn from others.\n\n#### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)\n\n**Advanced Topics to Explore:**\n- **Embodied AI and Deep Active Inference Agents**: Collaborate with researchers like Tetsuya Ogata to explore embodied AI and deep active inference agents, focusing on complex, continuous state-spaces[5].\n- **Cognitive Map Learning and Planning**: Work with Toon Van de Maele and others on integrating cognitive map learning and Active Inference for planning in ambiguous environments[5].\n\n**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**\n- **Collaborative Research Projects**: Engage in collaborative research projects within the AIF community, such as those focused on social sciences ontologies for health and disease, or negotiation affordances in collective foraging[5].\n- **Industry Applications**: Collaborate with industry partners to apply Active Inference in finance, business processes, robotics, or other relevant domains.\n\n**Application Projects in Their Domain:**\n- **Finance and Business Processes**: Develop and implement Active Inference models for dynamic trading, inventory management, or other financial and business applications.\n- **Reinforcement Learning Integration**: Integrate Active Inference with Reinforcement Learning techniques, such as DDPG or DQN, to enhance decision-making processes in various domains[2].\n\n**Skill-Building Activities:**\n- **Julia Programming**: Enhance skills in Julia programming by working on RxInfer.jl projects and contributing to the open-source package.\n- **Math Group Sessions**: Participate in informal Math Group sessions organized by the Active Inference Institute to deepen mathematical understanding of Active Inference concepts[5].\n\n#### SPECIFIC RESOURCES\n\n**Active Inference Institute Materials:**\n- **EduActive Unit Projects**: Utilize projects and resources provided by the EduActive unit, including textbook materials and RxInfer.jl usage[5].\n- **ReInference Unit Research**: Engage with the research and development work at the ReInference unit, focusing on practical applications and community projects[5].\n\n**Academic Papers and Tutorials:**\n- **\"From pixels to planning: scale-free active inference\"**: Study this paper to understand the latest developments in generative modeling and hierarchical forms within Active Inference[3].\n- **Kobus Esterhuysen's Projects**: Review and build upon the projects published on `learnableloop.com` and `learnableloop.ai`, such as dynamic trading and Bayesian regression[2].\n\n**Software Tools and Frameworks:**\n- **RxInfer.jl**: Use and contribute to the RxInfer.jl package for practical implementation of Active Inference models[5].\n- **Julia Programming**: Use Julia for implementing and testing Active Inference models.\n\n**Community Resources and Events:**\n- **Active Inference Institute Workshops and Conferences**: Attend workshops and conferences organized by the Active Inference Institute to network and learn from other researchers and practitioners[5].\n- **Discord Community**: Engage actively in the RxInfer.jl learning and development group on Discord.\n\n**Domain-Specific Applications:**\n- **Finance and Business**: Apply Active Inference in dynamic trading, inventory management, and other financial or business
