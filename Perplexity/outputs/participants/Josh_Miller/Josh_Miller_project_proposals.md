### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Integrating Episodic Memory in Active Inference Agents

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create an Active Inference agent that uses episodic memory to enhance its decision-making and planning capabilities in a simple environment.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, Active Inference agents rely on generative models to make decisions, but they often lack the ability to learn from past experiences efficiently. The integration of episodic memory, as seen in the Animal-AI environment, is a recent advancement but is mostly limited to discrete state spaces and small environments[1].

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will integrate a Prioritised Replay Buffer (PRB) and a Temporal Episodic Memory (TEM) module into an Active Inference agent. The PRB will prioritize the learning of action-oriented experiences, while the TEM module will help the agent perceive the environment on a subjective timescale. This combination is expected to improve the agent's ability to make informed decisions and adapt to changing environments[1].

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will demonstrate the feasibility of enhancing Active Inference agents with episodic memory, potentially improving their performance in real-world applications such as robotics and autonomous systems. This could make a significant difference in fields requiring efficient learning and adaptation.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- The complexity of integrating PRB and TEM modules could introduce unforeseen challenges.
- The agent might not generalize well to larger or more complex environments.
- There is a risk of overfitting to the training data.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will primarily require computational resources (e.g., access to a GPU) and software tools like MATLAB or Python. The cost is estimated to be minimal, as most resources are likely already available.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take around 2-3 months, including setting up the environment, implementing the PRB and TEM modules, and testing the agent.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point (1 month):** Successful implementation of the PRB and TEM modules.
  - Evaluate the agent's performance in a simple environment.
  - Adjust parameters and refine the model as necessary.
- **Final Check Point (3 months):** Comprehensive testing of the agent in various environments.
  - Compare performance with a baseline Active Inference agent.
  - Document and present the findings.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Applying Active Inference to Mindfulness and Critical Thinking

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop an Active Inference framework to model and enhance mindfulness and critical thinking practices, leveraging Josh Miller's background in these areas.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, mindfulness and critical thinking practices are often guided by traditional methods without a strong theoretical foundation in computational neuroscience. Active Inference offers a promising framework for understanding and optimizing these practices but has not been widely applied in this context[2][4].

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will apply the Active Inference framework to model the cognitive processes involved in mindfulness and critical thinking. It will use predictive coding and generative models to simulate how individuals might optimize their mental states to achieve better mindfulness and critical thinking outcomes. The approach will be tested through simulations and potentially validated with real-world data.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project could lead to the development of more effective mindfulness and critical thinking training programs, benefiting individuals and organizations seeking to improve cognitive resilience and performance.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- The complexity of modeling complex cognitive processes.
- Limited availability of data to validate the models.
- Potential resistance to adopting new, theoretically-driven methods.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require access to computational resources, software tools, and potentially collaboration with experts in mindfulness and critical thinking. The estimated cost is moderate, mainly covering software, data collection, and potential collaborations.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take around 6-9 months, including literature review, model development, simulation, and validation.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point (3 months):** Successful development of the initial Active Inference model for mindfulness and critical thinking.
  - Conduct preliminary simulations to evaluate the model's performance.
  - Gather feedback from experts and practitioners.
- **Final Check Point (9 months):** Comprehensive validation and refinement of the model.
  - Collect and analyze real-world data to validate the model.
  - Document and present the findings, including any practical applications.

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing a Neuro-Bio-Social Active Inference Model for Social Dynamics

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop an integrated neuro-bio-social Active Inference model that explains and predicts social dynamics, leveraging insights from neuroscience, psychology, and sociology.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, social dynamics are studied across multiple disciplines, but there is a lack of a unified theoretical framework that integrates the biological, psychological, and social aspects. Active Inference offers a promising approach but requires significant development to be applied at this scale[4].

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will extend the Active Inference framework to incorporate neuro-bio-social interactions, using predictive coding and generative models to simulate how individuals and groups interact and adapt. The model will be developed in collaboration with experts from neuroscience, psychology, and sociology, ensuring a comprehensive and integrated approach.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project could lead to a profound understanding of social dynamics, enabling better predictions and interventions in fields such as social psychology, public health, and policy-making.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- The complexity of integrating multiple disciplinary perspectives.
- The need for extensive data collection and validation.
- Potential challenges in scaling the model to real-world social dynamics.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require significant resources, including computational power, software tools, and collaboration with experts across multiple disciplines. The estimated cost is high, covering data collection, software development, and potentially funding for a research team.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take around 1-2 years, including literature review, model development, data collection, and validation.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point (6 months):** Successful development of the initial neuro-bio-social Active Inference model.
  - Conduct preliminary simulations and gather feedback from experts.
  - Begin data collection for validation.
- **Final Check Point (1-2 years):** Comprehensive validation and refinement of the model.
  - Analyze and present the findings, including any practical applications and policy implications.
  - Publish the results in peer-reviewed journals and present at conferences.
