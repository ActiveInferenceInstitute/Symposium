### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Simulating Basic Active Inference Models

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create a simple simulation of an Active Inference agent to understand the basic principles of predictive coding and the free-energy principle.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, simulations of Active Inference models are often complex and require advanced programming skills. However, the basic concepts can be simplified and implemented using accessible tools like MATLAB or Python. The limit of current practice is that many tutorials and simulations are geared towards advanced users, making it difficult for novices to get started.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will focus on creating a step-by-step guide and simplified code for simulating a basic Active Inference agent. This approach will be new because it will be tailored for beginners, using clear documentation and easy-to-follow instructions. Success is likely because it will provide a hands-on introduction to Active Inference, allowing Josh Miller to understand the core concepts through practical implementation.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will make it easier for new learners, including Josh Miller, to enter the field of Active Inference. By providing a clear and accessible introduction, it will lower the barrier to entry and enable more people to contribute to and learn from Active Inference research.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risk is that the simplification might oversimplify the complex underlying theories, potentially leading to misunderstandings. However, this can be mitigated by ensuring the guide is thoroughly reviewed by experts in the field.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will likely be low-cost, as it involves using freely available software tools like MATLAB or Python and leveraging existing resources such as online tutorials and academic papers.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project should take approximately 1-2 weeks to complete, depending on the level of detail and the complexity of the simulation.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: After one week, review the initial simulation code and ensure it runs correctly. Gather feedback from peers or mentors.
- **Final Check Point**: After two weeks, complete the simulation, document the process, and share it with the community for feedback and validation.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with Model-Based Reinforcement Learning

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Integrate Active Inference with model-based reinforcement learning to enhance decision-making in dynamic environments.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, Active Inference and model-based reinforcement learning are often treated as separate frameworks. While there are some studies integrating these concepts, they are generally complex and require a deep understanding of both theories. The limits include the difficulty in scaling these integrated models to complex state spaces and the lack of clear guidelines for practical implementation.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will develop a clear, step-by-step methodology for integrating Active Inference with model-based reinforcement learning. It will involve:
- **Literature Review**: A comprehensive review of existing studies on the integration of Active Inference and reinforcement learning.
- **Simulation Development**: Creating simulations in Python using libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow to demonstrate the integration.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the integrated model in various dynamic environments.

Success is likely because this project will provide a practical and well-documented approach, making it easier for others to follow and build upon.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will make a significant difference by providing a unified framework that combines the strengths of Active Inference and model-based reinforcement learning. It will be beneficial for researchers and practitioners in AI, neuroscience, and related fields, enabling better decision-making in complex and dynamic environments.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of integrating two sophisticated frameworks and the potential for errors in implementation. Additionally, there is a risk that the integrated model may not perform as expected in all scenarios.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require access to computational resources and possibly some software licenses, but it should still be relatively low-cost. It may also involve collaboration with other researchers, which could be facilitated through online forums and academic networks.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project should take approximately 3-6 months to complete, depending on the depth of the integration and the complexity of the simulations.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: After 1.5 months, review the literature and initial simulation designs. Gather feedback from peers and mentors.
- **Final Check Point**: After 3-6 months, complete the simulations, evaluate the performance, and document the findings. Share the results with the community for feedback and validation.

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing a Neuro-Bio-Social Model Using Active Inference

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a comprehensive neuro-bio-social model that integrates Active Inference with sociological and biological aspects to understand collective behaviors and social dynamics.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, Active Inference is primarily applied within neuroscience and AI, with limited integration into sociological frameworks. The limits include the lack of a unified theoretical framework that combines these disciplines and the complexity of modeling social dynamics.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will develop a novel neuro-bio-social model by:
- **Theoretical Integration**: Integrating Active Inference with sociological theories to create a unified framework that explains collective behaviors and social dynamics.
- **Simulation Development**: Creating complex simulations that model social interactions and collective behaviors using the integrated framework.
- **Empirical Validation**: Validating the model using empirical data from sociological and psychological studies.

Success is likely because this project will provide a groundbreaking framework that bridges multiple disciplines, offering new insights into how social behaviors are shaped by both biological and environmental factors.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will make a significant impact by providing a comprehensive framework for understanding social behaviors and collective dynamics. It will be crucial for researchers in sociology, neuroscience, and AI, as well as policymakers and practitioners interested in social dynamics and behavior change.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of integrating multiple disciplines, the potential for theoretical inconsistencies, and the challenge of validating the model empirically. There is also a risk that the model may not be scalable to real-world scenarios.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will likely require significant resources, including computational power, access to large datasets, and potential collaborations with researchers from various fields. It may also involve funding for workshops or conferences to disseminate the findings.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project should take approximately 1-2 years to complete, depending on the depth of the integration and the complexity of the simulations and empirical validations.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: After 6 months, review the theoretical integration and initial simulation designs. Gather feedback from a diverse group of peers and mentors.
- **Final Check Point**: After 1-2 years, complete the simulations, validate the model empirically, and document the findings. Share the results with the community through publications and presentations.

Each of these proposals aligns with the participant's potential interests and capabilities, providing a structured path for learning and applying Active Inference in increasingly complex and impactful ways.
