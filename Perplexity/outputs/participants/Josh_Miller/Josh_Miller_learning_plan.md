Given the limited information about Josh Miller's background and current understanding of Active Inference, the learning plan will be structured to accommodate a potential newcomer to the field, with a focus on gradual progression and flexibility to adapt as more information becomes available.

## Immediate Next Steps (1-2 weeks)

### Specific Resources to Start With
- **Introduction to Active Inference**:
  - Start with the introductory sections of the paper "An active inference account of some features of conscious experience"[3].
  - Watch introductory videos or lectures on Active Inference, such as those by Karl Friston or other prominent researchers in the field.
- **Foundational Concepts**:
  - Read the section on "The free-energy principle and active inference" in the same paper[3].
  - Explore the basics of Bayesian inference and predictive coding through resources like the "Bayesian Brain" concept introduction[4].

### Initial Learning Objectives
- Understand the basic principles of Active Inference, including the free-energy principle and predictive coding.
- Familiarize yourself with the Bayesian inference framework.

### Concrete Actions to Take
- Spend 2-3 hours each day reading and taking notes on the introductory materials.
- Join online forums or discussion groups related to Active Inference (e.g., Reddit's r/Neuroscience or r/MachineLearning) to ask questions and engage with the community.
- Create a list of key terms and concepts to review regularly.

## Short-Term Goals (1-3 months)

### Key Concepts to Master
- **Predictive Coding and Generative Models**:
  - Delve deeper into predictive coding and how it relates to Active Inference[4].
