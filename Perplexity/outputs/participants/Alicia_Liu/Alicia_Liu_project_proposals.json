These methods have limitations, including the cold start problem and the inability to adapt quickly to changing user preferences.\n\n#### What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project will integrate active inference principles to dynamically update user models based on their interactions and preferences. By minimizing expected free energy, the model can actively seek out new information to improve recommendation accuracy. This approach is new because it incorporates the user's uncertainty and ambiguity into the recommendation process, potentially leading to more accurate and adaptive recommendations.\n\n#### Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nSuccess in this project will improve customer satisfaction and increase sales for luxury fashion brands. It will also demonstrate the feasibility of applying active inference in real-world commercial applications, making it a valuable case study for broader adoption.\n\n#### What are the risks?\n- The complexity of implementing active inference might be higher than anticipated.\n- The model may require significant tuning to work effectively with existing data systems.\n- There is a risk that the model may not outperform current methods in terms of recommendation accuracy.\n\n#### How much will it cost?\n- This project will primarily require time and computational resources, which can be managed within existing budgets.\n- Potential costs include software licenses for machine learning frameworks and any necessary data storage solutions.\n\n#### How long will it take?\n- This project can be completed within 2-3 months, given the focused scope and Alicia Liu's existing knowledge in the luxury fashion industry.\n\n#### What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Mid-term Checkpoint (1 month):**\n  - Completion of the initial model implementation.\n  - Preliminary testing with a small dataset.\n- **Final Checkpoint (2-3 months):**\n  - Full-scale testing with a larger dataset.\n  - Evaluation of the model's performance against existing recommendation systems.\n\n**Technical Details and Methodologies:**\n- Implement a simple active inference model using PyTorch or TensorFlow.\n- Use Bayesian inference libraries like PyMC3 to handle probabilistic reasoning.\n- Integrate the model with existing customer interaction data to test its efficacy.\n\n**Potential Collaborators or Resources:**\n- Collaborate with data scientists or machine learning engineers within the luxury fashion industry.\n- Utilize online resources and forums focused on active inference and machine learning.\n\n---\n\n### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Multi-Task Uplift Modeling with Active Inference\n\n#### What are you trying to do?\nDevelop a multi-task uplift modeling framework that incorporates active inference to optimize treatment effects in various tasks, such as click-through rates and conversion rates, leveraging Alicia Liu's experience in multiple industries.\n\n#### How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrent multi-task uplift modeling approaches often use separate models for each task or employ hard parameter sharing without actively seeking new information to improve estimates. These methods can be limited by their inability to adapt dynamically and integrate multiple tasks seamlessly.\n\n#### What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project will use active inference to integrate multiple tasks and treatments, allowing the model to actively seek out new information to minimize expected free energy and improve uplift estimates. This approach is new because it combines the principles of active inference with multi-task learning, enabling more nuanced and adaptive estimation of treatment effects.\n\n#### Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nSuccess in this project will significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of multi-task uplift modeling across various industries, including marketing and healthcare. It will demonstrate the power of integrating active inference with multi-task learning, making it a valuable contribution to the field.\n\n#### What are the risks?\n- Integrating active inference with multi-task learning can be complex and may require significant computational resources.\n- The model might require extensive tuning to handle different tasks and treatments effectively.\n- There is a risk that the model may not outperform existing multi-task uplift models.\n\n#### How much will it cost?\n- This project will require more substantial computational resources and potentially more software licenses for advanced machine learning frameworks.\n- Costs will also include any necessary data storage and processing solutions.\n\n#### How long will it take?\n- This project can be completed within 6-9 months, given the moderate scope and the need for thorough testing and validation.\n\n#### What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Mid-term Checkpoint (3 months):**\n  - Completion of the initial multi-task uplift modeling framework.\n  - Preliminary testing with a small dataset.\n- **Final Checkpoint (6-9 months):**\n  - Full-scale testing with a larger dataset across multiple tasks.\n  - Evaluation of the model's performance against existing multi-task uplift models.\n\n**Technical Details and Methodologies:**\n- Implement a multi-task uplift modeling framework using deep learning architectures (e.g., multi-head networks, shared encoders).\n- Integrate active inference principles to actively seek new information and minimize expected free energy.\n- Use libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow and Bayesian inference libraries like PyMC3.\n\n**Potential Collaborators or Resources:**\n- Collaborate with researchers or practitioners experienced in multi-task learning and uplift modeling.\n- Utilize resources from the van der Schaar Lab on data-centric AI and multi-task learning[4].\n\n---\n\n### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing Cognitive AI with Humanlike Common Sense Using Active Inference\n\n#### What are you trying to do?\nDevelop a cognitive AI system that integrates active inference with the principles of humanlike common sense, focusing on functionality, physics, intent, causality, and utility (FPICU), leveraging Alicia Liu's diverse background in cultural and creative industries.\n\n#### How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrent AI systems often lack humanlike common sense and are limited to narrow tasks. They do not integrate the broader aspects of human understanding such as functionality, physics, intent, and causality, which are crucial for solving complex real-world problems.\n\n#### What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project will use active inference to develop a cognitive AI system that incorporates FPICU principles, enabling the system to solve a wide range of tasks with little training data. This approach is new because it combines the active inference framework with the \"dark matter\" of vision and cognition, allowing the system to understand the physical and social world in a more humanlike way.\n\n#### Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nSuccess in this project will revolutionize the field of AI by creating systems that can understand and interact with the world in a more humanlike manner.
