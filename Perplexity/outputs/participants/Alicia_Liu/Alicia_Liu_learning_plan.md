### Personalized Learning Plan for Alicia Liu: Active Inference

#### Immediate Next Steps (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Introduction to Active Inference:**
  - Start with the introductory paper on active inference and its underlying principles from the free energy perspective. The paper "Computational mechanisms of curiosity and goal-directed exploration" provides a clear theoretical framework and simulations to illustrate key concepts[2].
  - Read the section on "Introduction" and "Theoretical Framework" in the paper to understand the basics of active inference, active learning, and the free energy principle.

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the fundamental principles of active inference, including the free energy principle.
- Grasp the difference between active inference and active learning.
- Familiarize yourself with the concept of minimizing expected free energy.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Spend 2-3 hours reading and summarizing the key points from the introductory sections of the paper.
- Watch video lectures or webinars that introduce active inference, such as those available on the Active Inference Institute's website or YouTube channels related to cognitive science and Bayesian inference.
- Join online forums or discussion groups focused on active inference to ask initial questions and get a feel for the community.

#### Short-Term Goals (1-3 months)
