### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Applying Active Inference to User Engagement in Cultural Events

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
To develop a simple Active Inference model to predict and enhance user engagement at cultural events, such as art exhibitions or festivals, using data from past events.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, user engagement at cultural events is often analyzed using traditional statistical methods or basic machine learning algorithms. These methods lack the ability to dynamically adapt to changing user behaviors and do not account for the intrinsic uncertainty and ambiguity in user interactions. They also fail to integrate both pragmatic (action) and epistemic (information-gathering) values, which are crucial for understanding user engagement.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
The new approach involves using Active Inference to model user behavior as an active process of inference and action. By applying the free energy principle, the model can predict user engagement by minimizing the difference between expected and actual outcomes. This approach integrates both pragmatic and epistemic values, allowing for more accurate and adaptive predictions. Alicia Liu's background in cultural and creative industries will be crucial in interpreting the data and applying the model in a relevant context.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will make a significant difference to event organizers and cultural institutions by providing a more accurate and adaptive way to predict and enhance user engagement. This can lead to better event planning, increased audience satisfaction, and potentially higher attendance rates.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Data Quality:** The quality of the data from past events may be variable, which could affect the accuracy of the model.
- **Complexity:** Implementing Active Inference models can be technically challenging, especially for someone new to the field.
- **Limited Scope:** The initial scope may be too narrow, limiting the generalizability of the results.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
- **Time:** 1-2 months of part-time work.

  - Week 1-2: Literature review and data collection.
  - Week 3-4: Model implementation and initial testing.
  - Week 5-6: Refinement and validation of the model.
  - Week 7-8: Final report and presentation.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint:** After 4 weeks, evaluate the initial model implementation and data analysis.
  - Assess whether the model is accurately predicting user engagement.
  - Adjust the model parameters and data preprocessing as necessary.
- **Final Checkpoint:** After 8 weeks, evaluate the final model performance and prepare a report.
  - Compare the results with traditional methods to assess the improvement.
  - Present the findings to stakeholders and discuss potential applications.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Developing an Active Inference Framework for Cross-Cultural User Behavior Analysis

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
To develop a comprehensive Active Inference framework that can analyze and predict user behavior across different cultural contexts, leveraging Alicia Liu's expertise in cross-cultural communication.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, user behavior analysis across cultures often relies on static models that do not account for the dynamic and adaptive nature of human behavior. These models also lack the integration of both pragmatic and epistemic values, which are essential for understanding how users interact with their environment in different cultural settings.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
The new approach involves developing an Active Inference framework that incorporates cultural variables and dynamic adaptation. By using the free energy principle, the framework can predict user behavior by minimizing the difference between expected and actual outcomes across different cultural contexts. This approach will leverage Alicia Liu's deep understanding of Chinese and European markets to ensure the framework is culturally sensitive and adaptive.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will significantly impact businesses and organizations operating in multiple cultural markets by providing a robust and adaptive framework for understanding and predicting user behavior. This can lead to better marketing strategies, improved product design, and enhanced user satisfaction.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Cultural Complexity:** Integrating cultural variables into the model can be complex and requires careful consideration to avoid cultural biases.
- **Data Availability:** Access to comprehensive data across different cultures may be limited.
- **Technical Challenges:** Implementing and validating the Active Inference framework can be technically demanding.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
- **Time:** 6-9 months of part-time work.
- **Resources:** Access to cross-cultural data, advanced computational resources, potential collaborations with researchers or students, and attendance at relevant conferences or workshops.

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Integrating Active Inference with Immersive Storytelling in Cultural Productions

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
To integrate Active Inference principles into immersive storytelling experiences in cultural productions, such as interactive art exhibitions or virtual reality (VR) cultural events, to enhance user engagement and create more adaptive and dynamic storytelling environments.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, immersive storytelling experiences often use static scripts or basic interactive elements that do not adapt to the user's behavior in real-time. These methods lack the ability to integrate both pragmatic and epistemic values, leading to a less engaging and less personalized experience for the user.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
The new approach involves using Active Inference to create adaptive storytelling environments that dynamically adjust based on user interactions. By applying the free energy principle, the system can predict and adapt to user behavior in real-time, enhancing the engagement and immersion of the storytelling experience. Alicia Liu's expertise in cultural and creative industries will be crucial in designing and implementing these adaptive storytelling environments.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will make a significant impact on the cultural and creative industries by providing a new paradigm for immersive storytelling. This can lead to more engaging and personalized cultural experiences, increased audience satisfaction, and new avenues for artistic expression.
