### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Developing an Active Inference Framework for Real-Time User Engagement in Educational Settings

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a simple, real-time framework to infer user engagement in educational interactions using Active Inference principles.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, user engagement is often measured through self-report scales or simple session-level cues like session length and number of turns. However, these methods have limitations, such as being retrospective or potentially misinterpreting user behavior (e.g., a long session might indicate frustration rather than engagement)[1].

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will use textual cues from user interactions to infer engagement in real-time, leveraging Active Inference to model the predictive processing of user inputs. By annotating user utterances and using hierarchical regression to integrate various cue groups, the framework can provide a more nuanced and immediate measure of engagement. This approach is new because it combines the theoretical underpinnings of Active Inference with practical, real-time data analysis.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Educators and educational psychologists will benefit from this framework as it provides real-time feedback on student engagement, allowing for more timely and effective interventions. This can lead to improved learning outcomes and better support for marginalized students.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- The complexity of integrating Active Inference into existing educational frameworks.
- Potential biases in the annotation scheme.
- Limited generalizability if the model is not tested across diverse educational settings.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
- Initial costs will be low, primarily involving time and resources for developing the annotation scheme and running the hierarchical regression analysis.
- Potential costs for software tools or consulting with experts in Active Inference.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- This project can be completed within 2-3 months, given the focused scope and the use of existing data and tools.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point:** After 1 month, evaluate the initial annotation scheme and the correlation coefficients between the annotated cues and user engagement.
  - **Final Check Point:** After 3 months, assess the effectiveness of the framework in a pilot educational setting and gather feedback from educators.

**Technical Details and Methodologies:**
- Use manual annotation to identify engagement cues from user transcripts.
- Apply hierarchical regression to integrate annotated variables, LIWC variables, and descriptive variables.
- Utilize software tools like R or Python for data analysis.

**Potential Collaborators or Resources:**
- Collaborate with educational researchers to gather and annotate data.
- Use resources from the Active Inference Institute for theoretical guidance.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with Educational Technologies to Enhance Learning Outcomes

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop an educational platform that integrates Active Inference principles to dynamically adjust the learning environment and enhance learning outcomes for marginalized students.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current educational technologies often use static learning paths and lack real-time adaptation to student behavior. This can result in a one-size-fits-all approach that may not effectively support marginalized students.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will integrate Active Inference models into educational technologies to create a dynamic learning environment. By using predictive processing to model student behavior, the platform can adapt the learning content, pace, and style in real-time to better engage and support students. This approach leverages the latest advancements in Active Inference and educational psychology.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Educators, policymakers, and most importantly, marginalized students will benefit from this platform. It can lead to more personalized and effective learning experiences, improving educational outcomes and reducing disparities.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- Technical challenges in integrating Active Inference with existing educational technologies.
- Potential resistance from educators and administrators to adopt new methodologies.
- Ensuring the platform is culturally sensitive and socially just.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
- Moderate costs involving software development, data analysis tools, and potential consulting fees.
- Estimated budget: $50,000 - $100,000.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- This project will take approximately 6-9 months to complete, including development, testing, and initial implementation.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point:** After 3 months, evaluate the initial integration of Active Inference models with the educational platform.
  - **Final Check Point:** After 9 months, conduct a pilot implementation in several educational settings and gather comprehensive feedback.

**Technical Details and Methodologies:**
- Use Python libraries (e.g., `pytorch` or `tensorflow`) to implement Active Inference models.
- Integrate these models with learning management systems (LMS) or other educational technologies.

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing a Comprehensive Active Inference-Based Educational Policy Framework

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a comprehensive educational policy framework that integrates Active Inference principles to inform and improve educational practices and policies, particularly for marginalized students.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current educational policies often lack a robust theoretical foundation and may not adequately address the needs of marginalized students. Policies are often static and do not adapt to changing educational environments.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will leverage Active Inference to create a dynamic and adaptive policy framework. By modeling the predictive processing of educational systems, the framework can provide real-time insights and recommendations for policy adjustments. This approach combines the theoretical rigor of Active Inference with practical policy implementation.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Policymakers, educators, and the broader educational community will benefit from this framework. It can lead to more effective, adaptive, and inclusive educational policies, ultimately improving educational outcomes and social justice.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- Resistance from established policy frameworks and stakeholders.
- Complexity in integrating Active Inference into policy-making processes.
- Ensuring the framework is scalable and generalizable across different educational settings.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
