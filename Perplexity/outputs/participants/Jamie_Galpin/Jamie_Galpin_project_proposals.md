### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Applying Active Inference to Predict Student Engagement

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and test a pilot study to use Active Inference to predict student engagement in a classroom setting, focusing on marginalized groups.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, predicting student engagement often relies on subjective teacher observations or self-report measures, which can be retrospective and may not capture real-time engagement. These methods lack the precision and immediacy that Active Inference could provide by analyzing behavioral and cognitive cues.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will apply Active Inference models to analyze student behavior and cognitive processes in real-time. By using eye-tracking metrics and other behavioral cues, the project aims to develop a more accurate and immediate method for predicting student engagement. This approach leverages Jamie Galpin's expertise in developmental psychology and his understanding of Active Inference, making it a promising methodology.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Educators, policymakers, and students, especially those from marginalized groups, will benefit from this project. Accurate prediction of student engagement can help tailor educational strategies to better meet the needs of all students, enhancing learning outcomes and equity.

#### 5. What are the risks?
Risks include the technical challenges of implementing eye-tracking and other data collection methods, ensuring the privacy and ethical treatment of student data, and the potential for initial resistance from educators to new methodologies.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The initial cost will include the purchase or rental of eye-tracking equipment, software licenses for data analysis, and possibly hiring a research assistant. Estimated costs could be around $10,000 to $20,000.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This pilot study is expected to take approximately 2-3 months to design, implement, and analyze.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Developing an Interdisciplinary Active Inference Framework for Educational Settings

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a comprehensive, interdisciplinary framework that integrates Active Inference with other cognitive theories (such as embodied cognition) to support student behavior and learning in educational settings, with a focus on marginalized groups.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current educational frameworks often lack a unified, theoretically grounded approach that integrates multiple cognitive theories. They may rely on fragmented methods that do not fully address the complex needs of marginalized students.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will create a holistic framework by integrating Active Inference with embodied cognition and other relevant theories. By combining these approaches, the framework will offer a more complete understanding of student behavior and learning processes. Jamie Galpin's background in developmental psychology and social justice ensures that the framework will be culturally sensitive and effective.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Educators, policymakers, and students will benefit from a more integrated and effective educational framework. This framework can lead to better learning outcomes, improved student engagement, and enhanced equity in education.

#### 5. What are the risks?
Risks include the complexity of integrating multiple theoretical frameworks, ensuring the framework's practical applicability, and potential resistance from educators to adopt new methodologies.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
Estimated costs include hiring research assistants, software licenses, and potential travel to workshops or conferences. The total cost could range from $50,000 to $100,000.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 6-9 months to complete, including literature review, framework development, pilot testing, and refinement.
