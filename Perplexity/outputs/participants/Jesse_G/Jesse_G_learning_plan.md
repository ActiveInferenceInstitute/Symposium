### Immediate Next Steps (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Active Inference Institute Materials:** Register for the upcoming Cohort 7 of the Textbook Group project, which includes additional informal Math Group sessions and RxInfer.jl usage. This can be done through the Active Inference Institute's education unit[3].
- **Academic Papers:** Start with the paper "Resilience and active inference" to deepen your understanding of how active inference can be applied to complex adaptive systems[1].
- **Mathematical Derivations:** Review the concise mathematical description of active inference in discrete time available on GitHub. This will help you develop a more rigorous derivation of the free energy principle[2].

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the basic mathematical framework of active inference.
- Familiarize yourself with the concept of resilience within the active inference framework.
- Begin engaging with the Active Inference Institute's community and resources.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Read and annotate the paper "Resilience and active inference" to grasp the three senses of resilience (inertia, elasticity, and plasticity) and how they are mapped within the active inference framework[1].
- Implement a simple active inference agent using the GitHub script to get hands-on experience with the mathematical derivations[2].
- Join the Active Inference Institute's community forums and introduce yourself, expressing your interests and seeking feedback on your current projects.

### Short-Term Goals (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Free Energy Principle:** Delve deeper into the mathematical derivations and applications of the free energy principle.
- **Active Inference Framework:** Understand how active inference integrates perception and action, and how it minimizes prediction error (surprise)[4].
- **Resilience and Adaptive Learning:** Explore how resilience is formalized within active inference and its implications for adaptive learning.

**Practical Exercises or Projects:**
- **Agent-Based Modeling:** Develop an agent-based model that incorporates the concepts of resilience and adaptive learning. Use resources like the RxInfer.jl package for this purpose[3].
- **Case Studies:** Apply active inference to specific case studies in habit formation and theological studies to see how the framework can be used in diverse domains.

**Recommended Study Materials:**
- **Textbook and Math Group Sessions:** Participate in the Textbook Group project and attend the informal Math Group sessions to improve your mathematical understanding of active inference[3].
- **Papers and Tutorials:**
  - Read the paper "Active Inference in Autonomous Vehicle Control" to see how active inference is applied in a different domain and to understand its adaptability and generalization capabilities[4].
  - Explore the dynamic causal modeling (DCM) approach in the context of self-regulation learning as described in the paper "Self-regulation learning as active inference"[5].

**Community Engagement Opportunities:**
- **Active Inference Institute Events:** Participate in livestreams and guest streams organized by the Active Inference Institute, such as the recent "Active Data Sampling" and "The Nature of Habits and Agential Systems"[3].
- **Collaborative Publishing:** Seek opportunities to co-author papers or contribute to community projects to gain more formal recognition and validation.

### Medium-Term Development (3-6 months)

**Advanced Topics to Explore:**
- **Integration with Other Frameworks:** Study the relationship between active inference and other frameworks like control-as-inference (CAI) and reinforcement learning. This can help in integrating different approaches and enhancing the robustness of your models[2][5].
- **Neural Mechanisms:** Dive deeper into the neural underpinnings of self-regulation learning using dynamic causal modeling (DCM) and real-time functional MRI data as described in the paper "Self-regulation learning as active inference"[5].

**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**
- **Interdisciplinary Collaborations:** Reach out to researchers from psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, and theology to collaborate on projects that integrate active inference with these fields.
- **Technical Contributions:** Collaborate with researchers working on the technical aspects of active inference, such as those involved in the RxInfer.jl learning and development group[3].

**Application Projects in Your Domain:**
- **Habit Formation and Adaptive Learning:** Develop a comprehensive model using active inference to study habit formation and adaptive learning. This could involve creating simulations or conducting experiments.
- **Theological Studies:** Apply active inference to theological studies, exploring how the framework can be used to understand and model complex behaviors and beliefs.

**Skill-Building Activities:**
- **Mathematical Rigor:** Continue to improve your mathematical derivations by working through advanced mathematical texts and participating in the Math Group sessions.
- **Software Proficiency:** Become proficient in using RxInfer.jl and other relevant software tools to implement and simulate active inference models.
