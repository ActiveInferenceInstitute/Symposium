### Project Proposal 1: Implementing Active Inference Models for Adaptive Learning Using RxInfer.jl

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and implement simple active inference models to simulate and analyze adaptive learning scenarios, using the RxInfer.jl package.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, adaptive learning models often rely on traditional machine learning or reinforcement learning techniques, which may not fully capture the dynamic interaction between the agent and its environment. The limits include the lack of a unified framework that integrates perception and action, and the difficulty in modeling complex behavioral adaptations.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will utilize the Active Inference framework, which integrates perception and action through variational inference on a unified objective function. By using the RxInfer.jl package, we can leverage its community resources and pre-built functions to implement and simulate active inference models efficiently. This approach is new because it applies Active Inference specifically to adaptive learning, allowing for a more holistic understanding of how agents adapt to their environments.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will provide a novel approach to understanding adaptive learning, which can be crucial in educational psychology, cognitive science, and AI research. It will offer a more comprehensive model of how agents learn and adapt, potentially leading to better educational interventions and more effective AI systems.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- Technical challenges in implementing the models using RxInfer.jl.
- Limited availability of relevant datasets for validation.
- Potential misinterpretation of the results if the models are not properly calibrated.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will primarily rely on free and open-source resources (RxInfer.jl package, community support), so the costs will be minimal, mainly time and effort.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- **Immediate Next Steps (1-2 weeks):** Familiarize yourself with the RxInfer.jl package and its community resources.
- **Short-Term Goals (1-3 months):** Implement and simulate simple active inference models for adaptive learning scenarios.
- **Mid-term Checkpoints:** Monthly reviews to assess the progress and adjust the plan as necessary.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Weekly Progress Reports:** Track the implementation progress and any challenges faced.
- **Monthly Review:** Assess the simulation results and adjust the models as needed.
- **Final Checkpoint:** Present the findings and models at a community workshop or symposium to receive feedback.

### Project Proposal 2: Integrating Active Inference with Reinforcement Learning for Technological Interventions

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a framework that integrates Active Inference with reinforcement learning to create more effective technological interventions for modifying persisting behaviors.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current technological interventions often use either Active Inference or reinforcement learning separately. The limits include the lack of a unified approach that combines the strengths of both frameworks, leading to potential inefficiencies in behavior modification.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will combine the predictive modeling of Active Inference with the action selection mechanisms of reinforcement learning. By leveraging the free energy principle and variational inference from Active Inference, and the reward-based learning from reinforcement learning, we can create a more robust and adaptive system for behavior modification. This integrated approach is new and promising because it can potentially offer more precise and effective interventions.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success will provide a novel and more effective framework for technological interventions, which can be crucial in fields such as psychology, education, and public health. It will offer better tools for modifying persisting behaviors, leading to improved outcomes in areas like habit formation and behavioral health.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- Technical challenges in integrating two complex frameworks.
- Potential complexity in interpreting the results due to the combined approaches.
- Limited availability of datasets for validation.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require minimal costs, mainly time and effort, as it leverages existing open-source frameworks and community resources.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- **Short-Term Goals (1-3 months):** Literature review and initial framework design.
- **Medium-Term Development (3-6 months):** Implementation and simulation of the integrated framework.
- **Mid-term Checkpoints:** Quarterly reviews to assess the integration progress and adjust the plan as necessary.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Quarterly Progress Reports:** Track the integration progress and any challenges faced.
- **Mid-term Review:** Assess the preliminary results of the integrated framework and adjust as needed.
- **Final Checkpoint:** Publish a research paper or present the findings at a symposium to receive feedback and recognition.

### Project Proposal 3: Developing an Active Inference Ontology for Interdisciplinary Research and Collaboration

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create an Active Inference ontology that aligns with various interdisciplinary frameworks (e.g., cognitive science, mathematics, philosophy) to facilitate better collaboration and research integration across different fields.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, Active Inference research is often siloed within specific disciplines, lacking a unified ontological framework that can bridge different fields. The limits include the difficulty in integrating concepts and findings across different disciplinary languages and frameworks.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will build on existing ontological works, such as those by Dave Douglass at the Active Inference Institute, to create a comprehensive ontology that aligns Active Inference with other relevant frameworks. By using tools like SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology) and engaging with interdisciplinary communities, we can develop a shared language and set of concepts that facilitate cross-disciplinary research. This approach is new because it aims to create a unified ontological framework specifically for Active Inference, enhancing collaboration and knowledge sharing.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success will provide a foundational tool for interdisciplinary research, enabling better collaboration and integration of findings across cognitive science, mathematics, philosophy, and other relevant fields. This will accelerate advancements in Active Inference and its applications, leading to more innovative and impactful research outcomes.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- Complexity in aligning diverse disciplinary frameworks.
- Potential resistance from researchers accustomed to discipline-specific terminologies.
- Time-consuming process of building consensus across different communities.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require minimal financial costs but significant time and effort. It may also involve collaboration with other researchers and community engagement, which could be resource-intensive.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- **Medium-Term Development (3-6 months):** Initial ontology design and alignment with existing frameworks.
- **Long-Term Development (6-12 months):** Community engagement, feedback, and iterative refinement of the ontology.
- **Mid-term Checkpoints:** Bi-annual reviews to assess the progress and adjust the plan as necessary.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Bi-annual Progress Reports:** Track the ontology development progress and any challenges faced.
- **Mid-term Review:** Assess the preliminary ontology and gather feedback from the community.
- **Final Checkpoint:** Publish the ontology in a peer-reviewed journal or present it at a major conference to receive final feedback and recognition.
