### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Implementing a Simple Active Inference Agent

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create and implement a simple active inference agent to understand the basic mathematical framework and practical application of active inference.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, active inference agents are often implemented using complex mathematical models and advanced software tools. However, for beginners, these implementations can be daunting. The limits include the need for a strong mathematical background and proficiency in specific software packages like RxInfer.jl.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project involves using a simplified GitHub script to implement an active inference agent. This approach is new because it provides a hands-on, step-by-step introduction to active inference, making it more accessible to those without extensive prior experience. It will be successful because it leverages existing resources (like the GitHub script) and aligns with Jesse's immediate learning objectives to understand the basic mathematical framework.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will help Jesse gain practical experience with active inference, enhancing his understanding and ability to apply the theory. This will make a difference by allowing him to engage more effectively with the Active Inference Institute's community and resources, and to build a foundation for more advanced projects.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risk is the potential for misunderstandings or misimplementations of the mathematical models, which could lead to incorrect results. However, this risk can be mitigated by close adherence to the script and seeking feedback from the community.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project is cost-free, as it utilizes open-source resources and existing community materials.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project should take approximately 1-2 weeks to complete, depending on the depth of implementation and the frequency of community interactions.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Week 1:** Complete the initial reading and understanding of the GitHub script.
- **Week 2:** Implement the simple active inference agent and run initial tests.
- **Final Check Point:** Present the implemented agent to the Active Inference Institute community for feedback and validation.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Applying Active Inference to Habit Formation and Adaptive Learning

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a comprehensive model using active inference to study habit formation and adaptive learning, and apply this model to real-world case studies.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, habit formation and adaptive learning are studied using various psychological and behavioral models, but these often lack the integrative framework provided by active inference. The limits include the lack of a unified theoretical framework that incorporates both perception and action.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project integrates active inference with habit formation and adaptive learning by using the free energy principle and variational inference. The new approach involves using the RxInfer.jl package to simulate and model these processes, providing a more holistic understanding of how habits form and adapt. It will be successful because it leverages Jesse's existing interests and expertise in cognitive science and mathematics.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of habit formation and adaptive learning within the active inference framework. This will make a difference by providing new insights into these processes, which can be applied in various fields such as psychology, education, and public health.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risks include the complexity of modeling real-world habits and adaptive learning, and the potential for oversimplification of the underlying processes. Additionally, there is a risk of not finding significant differences or improvements over existing models.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project is also cost-free, as it utilizes open-source resources and existing community materials.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project should take approximately 3-6 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the models and the depth of the case studies.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Month 1-2:** Develop the theoretical framework and initial simulations.
- **Month 3-4:** Apply the model to real-world case studies and collect data.
- **Month 5-6:** Analyze the results, write a report, and present the findings to the community.
- **Final Check Point:** Publish the results in a community journal or present at an Active Inference Institute event.

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Integrating Active Inference with Control-as-Inference (CAI) and Reinforcement Learning

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Integrate active inference with control-as-inference (CAI) and reinforcement learning to develop a more robust and adaptive decision-making framework, and apply this framework to complex adaptive systems.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, active inference, CAI, and reinforcement learning are often treated as separate frameworks. The limits include the lack of a unified approach that combines the strengths of these methods, particularly in handling complex and dynamic environments.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project involves developing a hybrid framework that combines the predictive coding and free energy minimization of active inference with the optimization principles of CAI and the adaptive learning of reinforcement learning. The new approach will leverage deep neural networks to scale up the models and handle complex state-spaces. It will be successful because it addresses the limitations of each individual framework by integrating their strengths, providing a more comprehensive and adaptive decision-making model.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will make a significant difference by providing a more robust and adaptive decision-making framework that can be applied across various domains such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and cognitive science. This integration will enhance the capabilities of current models in handling uncertainty and dynamic environments.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risks include the complexity of integrating different theoretical frameworks, the potential for computational infeasibility, and the challenge of validating the hybrid model against existing benchmarks.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project may require some costs associated with computational resources, software licenses, and potential collaborations with other researchers. However, much of the work can still be done using open-source resources.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take around 6-12 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the integration and the scope of the applications.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Month 1-3:** Develop the theoretical framework and initial simulations.
- **Month 4-6:** Implement the hybrid model using deep neural networks and test its performance on simple tasks.
- **Month 7-9:** Apply the model to complex adaptive systems and collect data.
- **Month 10-12:** Analyze the results, write a comprehensive report, and prepare for publication.
- **Final Check Point:** Present the findings at a major conference or publish in a prestigious journal to gain broader recognition.
