### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Exploring Affective and Autonomic Arousal Coherence

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
This project aims to understand and visualize the coherence between affective arousal (how one feels) and autonomic arousal (physiological responses like heart rate and pupil dilation) using the Active Inference framework. The goal is to create a simple, interactive tool that demonstrates this coherence.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, researchers use complex statistical analyses and neuroimaging techniques to study the relationship between affective and autonomic arousal. However, these methods are often inaccessible to those without a strong background in neuroscience and computational methods. The limits include the need for specialized equipment and expertise, making it hard for newcomers to engage with the topic.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project introduces an interactive, user-friendly tool that simulates the Active Inference model for arousal coherence. Using Python or MATLAB, the tool will allow users to input hypothetical scenarios and visualize how affective and autonomic arousal levels change in response. This approach is new because it simplifies complex concepts into an engaging and educational format.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will make the Active Inference framework more accessible to a broader audience, including students, researchers, and clinicians. It will facilitate a better understanding of how our bodies and minds integrate arousal signals, potentially leading to improved mental health interventions.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of simplifying the Active Inference model without losing its core principles and the potential for misinterpretation of the simulated results. Additionally, there is a risk that the tool might not be user-friendly enough, limiting its adoption.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project will require minimal costs, primarily related to software licenses (e.g., MATLAB or Python libraries) and possibly some online resources or courses to enhance coding skills.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project should take approximately 2-3 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the simulations and the user interface.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point (1 month):**
  - Complete a basic simulation model.
  - Test the model with simple scenarios.
  - Gather feedback from peers or mentors.
- **Final Check Point (3 months):**
  - Develop a user-friendly interface.
  - Validate the tool with real-world data or case studies.
  - Present the tool in a research group setting or online community.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with Neuroimaging for Clinical Applications

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
This project aims to integrate the Active Inference framework with neuroimaging techniques to better understand and predict clinical outcomes in mental health disorders, such as PTSD. The goal is to develop a methodology that uses neuroimaging data to validate and refine Active Inference models.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, researchers use neuroimaging techniques like fMRI to study brain activity, but integrating these data with Active Inference models is complex and often requires significant expertise. The limits include the high cost of neuroimaging data acquisition, the need for large sample sizes, and the complexity of data analysis[2].

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will use advanced data analysis techniques, such as dynamic functional connectivity and machine learning, to integrate neuroimaging data into Active Inference models. By leveraging open-source tools and standardized reporting formats (e.g., BIDS), the project aims to make this integration more accessible and reproducible.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will provide a more robust and validated approach to understanding mental health disorders using Active Inference. Clinicians and researchers will benefit from better predictive models, leading to more effective treatments and interventions.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of integrating neuroimaging data with Active Inference models, the high cost of data acquisition, and the potential for methodological biases. Additionally, there is a risk that the sample size may not be sufficient to achieve statistical power.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project will require moderate costs related to accessing neuroimaging data, software licenses (e.g., for fMRI analysis), and possibly collaborating with neuroimaging experts.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project should take approximately 6-9 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the data integration and the availability of neuroimaging data.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point (3 months):**
  - Complete the data preprocessing and initial integration with Active Inference models.
  - Conduct preliminary analysis to validate the methodology.
  - Gather feedback from peers and mentors.
- **Final Check Point (9 months):**
  - Complete the full integration and validation of the methodology.
  - Publish a research paper or present the findings at a conference.
  - Collaborate with clinicians to apply the methodology in real-world settings.

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing a Comprehensive Active Inference Model for Adaptive Learning and Regulation of Arousal

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
This project aims to develop a comprehensive Active Inference model that incorporates interoceptive inferences, autonomic arousal, affective arousal, and meta-awareness to predict and regulate adaptive learning and arousal responses. The goal is to create a robust, scalable model that can be applied across various domains, including mental health, education, and human performance.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, Active Inference models focus on specific aspects of arousal or learning but lack a comprehensive integration of all these components. The limits include the complexity of modeling multiple levels of awareness and arousal, the need for large datasets, and the challenge of validating such models in real-world settings[1][4].

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will use advanced computational neuroscience techniques, including hierarchical inference and multiscale models, to integrate all levels of arousal and awareness into a single, cohesive Active Inference model. The approach will leverage recent advances in neuroimaging, machine learning, and computational psychiatry to create a robust and scalable model.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will provide a groundbreaking framework for understanding adaptive learning and arousal regulation, impacting fields such as mental health treatment, educational psychology, and human performance enhancement. It will enable the development of personalized interventions and training programs that optimize individual adaptability and well-being.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the high complexity of the model, the need for extensive data collection and validation, and the potential for theoretical or methodological flaws. Additionally, there is a risk that the model may not generalize well across different populations or contexts.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project will require significant costs related to data collection, software development, and collaboration with experts from multiple fields. This may include funding for neuroimaging studies, software licenses, and personnel.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project should take approximately 1-2 years to complete, depending on the scope of the data collection and the complexity of the model development.

- **Mid-term Check Point (6 months):**
  - Complete the initial model development and preliminary validation.
  - Conduct a literature review to ensure the model aligns with current research.
  - Gather feedback from a diverse group of experts.
- **Final Check Point (1-2 years):**
  - Complete the full model development and extensive validation.
  - Publish a series of research papers detailing the methodology and results.
  - Collaborate with practitioners to implement the model in various domains and evaluate its real-world impact.
