Given the limited specific information about Arturo's background and current understanding of Active Inference, the following learning plan will be structured to be adaptable and comprehensive, covering various aspects of the field.

## Immediate Next Steps (1-2 weeks)

### Specific Resources to Start With
- **Video Tutorial**: Begin with the "A Step-by-Step Tutorial on Active Inference and its Application to Empirical Data" by Ryan Smith, Karl Friston, and Christopher Whyte. This tutorial provides a clear introduction to the core concepts of Active Inference and its practical applications[1].
- **Syllabus Overview**: Review the syllabus provided by Jared Tumiel, which outlines the necessary background and materials to understand the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference. This will help identify key areas to focus on[2].

### Initial Learning Objectives
- Understand the basic principles of Active Inference, including the role of generative models and variational inference.
- Familiarize yourself with the Free Energy Principle and its relationship to Active Inference.

### Concrete Actions to Take
- Watch the introductory video tutorial and take notes on key concepts.
- Browse through the syllabus to get an overview of the field and identify areas that align with your interests.
- Join online communities or forums related to Active Inference (e.g., activeinference.org) to ask initial questions and get a feel for the community.

## Short-Term Goals (1-3 months)

### Key Concepts to Master
- **Generative Models and Variational Inference**: Delve deeper into how generative models are used in Active Inference for both perception and action.
- **Free Energy Principle**: Understand the theoretical underpinnings of the FEP and how it relates to Active Inference.
- **Decision-Making Schemes**: Learn about different decision-making schemes such as the Deep Predictive Energy (DPEFE) scheme and counterfactual learning (CL) method[4].

### Practical Exercises or Projects
- **Simulations and Coding**: Use MATLAB or Python to implement simple Active Inference models. The GitHub repository by Beren Millidge provides detailed MATLAB code for discrete-state-space Active Inference[3].
- **Tutorials and Workshops**: Participate in online workshops or summer schools like the Neuromatch Academy or the Computational Neuroscience ‘Imbizo’ if possible[2].

### Recommended Study Materials
- **Textbook**: Refer to "Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms" by David MacKay for a deeper understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts[2].
- **Academic Papers**: Read key papers such as "A Step-by-Step Tutorial on Active Inference and its Application to Empirical Data" and "A free energy principle for biological systems" by Karl Friston[1][3].

### Community Engagement Opportunities
- **Online Forums**: Engage with the Active Inference community through forums and social media groups.
- **Webinars and Seminars**: Attend webinars or seminars on Active Inference and related topics to stay updated and network with other researchers.

## Medium-Term Development (3-6 months)

### Advanced Topics to Explore
