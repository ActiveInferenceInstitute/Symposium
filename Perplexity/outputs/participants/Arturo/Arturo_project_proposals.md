### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Simulating Active Inference in Simple Motor Tasks

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create a simple simulation to demonstrate how Active Inference can explain motor control and learning in basic tasks, such as reaching and grasping.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, simulations of motor control often use traditional control theories or simpler machine learning models. However, these models lack the integrated framework of perception, action, and learning provided by Active Inference. The limits include the inability to capture the full range of adaptive behaviors and the lack of a unified account of sensory processing and motor execution.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will use Active Inference to model the behavior of an agent performing simple motor tasks. By implementing generative models and variational inference, the simulation will demonstrate how the agent minimizes variational free energy to achieve optimal motor control. This approach is new because it integrates the free-energy principle with motor control, providing a more comprehensive and biologically plausible model.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will provide a clear, accessible example of Active Inference in action, making it easier for new researchers to understand and apply the framework. It will also contribute to the development of more realistic models of motor control, potentially benefiting fields like robotics and rehabilitation.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of implementing Active Inference models, especially for those new to the framework, and the potential for oversimplification of the motor tasks.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project is expected to be low-cost, primarily requiring computational resources and access to relevant software tools like MATLAB or Python.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take 1-2 months, depending on the complexity of the simulation and the participant's familiarity with the tools.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Week 1-2:** Set up the basic simulation environment and implement a simple generative model.
- **Week 3-4:** Integrate variational inference and start running initial simulations.
- **Week 5-6:** Analyze results, refine the model, and prepare a final report.
- **Final Check Point:** Present the simulation and results to the community or in a seminar.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Applying Active Inference to Understand Psychopathological Conditions

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a computational model using Active Inference to simulate and understand specific psychopathological conditions, such as schizophrenia or autism, by focusing on aberrant precision and sensory attenuation.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current models often use fragmented approaches to understand psychopathology, focusing on specific symptoms rather than the underlying inference processes. The limits include the lack of a unified framework that explains the full range of symptoms and behaviors associated with these conditions.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will apply Active Inference to model the behavior of individuals with psychopathological conditions by manipulating parameters such as precision and sensory attenuation. By using this framework, the project will provide a more integrated and biologically plausible explanation of these conditions. The approach is new because it leverages the Active Inference framework to simulate and predict the behavioral and perceptual anomalies seen in psychopathology.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will contribute significantly to the field of computational psychiatry, providing new insights into the underlying mechanisms of psychopathological conditions. This could lead to novel intervention strategies and a better understanding of these disorders.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of modeling complex psychiatric conditions and the need for robust empirical validation of the models.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require moderate resources, including access to computational tools, relevant datasets, and potentially collaboration with clinical researchers.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take 3-6 months, depending on the complexity of the models and the availability of data.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Month 1:** Review existing literature and set up the basic model framework.
- **Month 2-3:** Implement and run initial simulations, analyzing results for key parameters like precision and sensory attenuation.
- **Month 4-5:** Refine the model based on initial results and prepare for empirical validation.
- **Final Check Point:** Present the findings in a research paper or at a conference, and receive feedback from the community.

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Deep Active Inference for Autonomous Robotic Exploration

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and implement a deep Active Inference framework for autonomous robotic exploration, integrating advanced techniques like Monte Carlo tree search and deep neural architectures to optimize decision-making in uncertain environments.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current approaches to autonomous robotic exploration often use simpler decision-making algorithms or bandit methods that do not fully leverage the adaptive capabilities of Active Inference. The limits include the inability to efficiently balance exploration and exploitation in complex, real-world scenarios.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will extend the Active Inference framework by integrating deep learning techniques and Monte Carlo methods to enhance the decision-making capabilities of autonomous robots. The approach is new because it combines the free-energy principle with advanced computational methods, allowing for more efficient and adaptive exploration strategies.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will significantly impact the field of robotics and autonomous systems, enabling more efficient and adaptive exploration in complex environments. This could have applications in areas like mineralogical surveys, search and rescue missions, and environmental monitoring.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of integrating deep learning with Active Inference, the need for robust testing in real-world scenarios, and the potential for computational resource-intensive simulations.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require substantial resources, including access to advanced computational tools, collaboration with robotics experts, and potentially experimental setups for real-world testing.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take 6-12 months, depending on the complexity of the implementation and the availability of resources.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Month 1-2:** Review existing literature and set up the basic framework integrating deep learning and Active Inference.
- **Month 3-4:** Implement and test the initial model using simulated scenarios.
- **Month 5-6:** Refine the model and prepare for real-world testing.
- **Month 7-9:** Conduct real-world tests and analyze results.
- **Final Check Point:** Present the final results in a research paper or at a conference, and receive feedback from the community.

Each of these proposals is tailored to align with the participant's learning plan and interests, ensuring a structured and actionable approach to exploring and applying Active Inference.
