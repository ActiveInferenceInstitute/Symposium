### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Implementing Active Inference in a Simple Simulation Environment

**1. What are you trying to do?**
Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon:
- Implement a basic Active Inference agent in a simple simulation environment to understand the fundamental principles of Active Inference.

**2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**
- Currently, Active Inference agents are often implemented in complex environments or with advanced techniques, which can be daunting for beginners. The limits include the complexity of mathematical formulations and the need for extensive computational resources.

**3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?**
- This project will use the OpenAI Gym environment (e.g., Cart Pole) to create a simple and accessible simulation setup. By leveraging existing libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow, the project will focus on implementing the core components of Active Inference, such as the generative model and the free-energy minimization objective. This approach simplifies the learning process and makes it more manageable for someone new to Active Inference.

**4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?**
- Success in this project will provide Arturo with a solid foundation in Active Inference, enabling him to understand and apply the principles in more complex scenarios later on. It will also serve as a proof-of-concept for further research and application in his specific domain of interest.

**5. What are the risks?**
- The main risk is the potential for misunderstandings or misimplementations of the Active Inference framework, which could lead to incorrect conclusions about its efficacy. Additionally, the simplicity of the environment might not fully capture the complexities of real-world applications.

**6. How much will it cost?**
- This project requires minimal costs, primarily involving access to computational resources and software tools which are often freely available (e.g., OpenAI Gym, PyTorch).

**7. How long will it take?**
- The project is expected to take approximately 1-3 months, depending on Arturo's current level of understanding and the amount of time he can dedicate each week.

**8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?**
- **Mid-term Check Point:** Implement the basic components of the Active Inference agent (e.g., generative model, action selection based on free-energy minimization) within the first month.
- **Final Check Point:** Successfully run the agent in the simulation environment and evaluate its performance in terms of stability and goal achievement within the next two months.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Episodic Memory into Active Inference Agents

**1. What are you trying to do?**
Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon:
- Enhance an Active Inference agent by integrating episodic memory to improve its decision-making capabilities in dynamic environments.

**2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**
- Current Active Inference agents often rely on immediate sensory data and do not incorporate long-term memory effectively. This limits their ability to make informed decisions based on past experiences.

**3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?**
- This project will build on the concept of episodic memory as introduced in the Animal-AI Environment project[1]. By integrating a Prioritised Replay Buffer (PRB) and a Temporal Episodic Memory (TEM) module, the agent will be able to learn from past experiences and define a subjective timescale for perceiving the environment. This approach leverages both model-based reinforcement learning and the free-energy principle to enhance the agent's performance.

**4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?**
- Success in this project will significantly improve the decision-making capabilities of Active Inference agents, particularly in environments where past experiences are crucial. This could have implications for various applications, including robotics, autonomous driving, and cognitive psychology.

**5. What are the risks?**
- The main risks include the complexity of integrating episodic memory into the existing Active Inference framework and the potential for increased computational costs. There is also a risk that the integration might not yield the expected improvements in decision-making.

**6. How much will it cost?**
- This project requires moderate computational resources and potentially some additional software tools or libraries for handling episodic memory. However, most of these resources are freely available or can be accessed through academic institutions.

**7. How long will it take?**
- The project is expected to take approximately 6-9 months, considering the complexity of integrating episodic memory and the need for thorough testing and evaluation.

**8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?**
- **Mid-term Check Point:** Successfully integrate the PRB and TEM modules into the Active Inference agent within the first three months.
- **Final Check Point:** Evaluate the performance of the enhanced agent in a dynamic environment, comparing it to a baseline agent without episodic memory, within the next six months.

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Applying Active Inference to Energy-Efficient Control in Manufacturing Systems

**1. What are you trying to do?**
Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon:
- Develop an Active Inference-based control system to optimize energy efficiency in manufacturing systems, leveraging deep learning and probabilistic modeling.

**2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**
- Current control systems in manufacturing often rely on traditional methods that do not fully account for uncertainty and dynamic changes in the system. These methods can be inefficient and do not optimize energy consumption effectively.

**3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?**
- This project will apply the principles of Active Inference, specifically deep active inference agents, to develop a control system that integrates perception, learning, and action under the free-energy principle[5]. By using Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and multi-step transition methods, the system will be able to handle the stochastic nature of manufacturing processes and optimize energy efficiency. This approach combines the strengths of Active Inference with deep learning to provide a robust and adaptive control system.

**4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?**
- Success in this project will lead to significant energy savings and improved efficiency in manufacturing systems. This could have a substantial impact on the environment and the operational costs of manufacturing facilities.

**5. What are the risks?**
- The main risks include the complexity of implementing Active Inference in a real-world manufacturing setting, the need for extensive data collection and preprocessing, and the potential for high computational costs. There is also a risk that the system might not generalize well across different manufacturing environments.

**6. How much will it cost?**
- This project will require significant computational resources, potentially specialized hardware, and access to real-world manufacturing data. It may also involve collaboration with industry partners, which could incur additional costs.

**7. How long will it take?**
- The project is expected to take approximately 1-2 years, considering the complexity of the task, the need for extensive testing, and the potential for iterative improvements.

**8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?**
- **Mid-term Check Point:** Develop a prototype of the Active Inference-based control system and test it in a simulated manufacturing environment within the first six months.
- **Final Check Point:** Implement and evaluate the system in a real-world manufacturing setting, comparing its performance to traditional control systems, within the next 18 months.

Each of these proposals is tailored to align with Arturo's potential background and interests, providing a structured path for learning and applying Active Inference in various contexts.
