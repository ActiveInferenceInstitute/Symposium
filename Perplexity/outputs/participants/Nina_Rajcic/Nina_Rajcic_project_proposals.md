### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Active Inference in Affective Interface Design

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and test a simple affective interface that incorporates active inference principles to enhance emotional self-reflection and user engagement.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, affective interfaces often rely on predefined emotional responses and lack the dynamic adaptability that active inference can offer. The limits include a lack of real-time emotional feedback and limited personalization.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will integrate active inference models into the design of an affective interface, allowing the system to adapt and learn from user interactions in real-time. This approach leverages Nina Rajcic's expertise in human-machine co-construction of emotion and her current learning in active inference.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will enhance the emotional intelligence of artificial agents, making them more responsive and engaging for users. This can improve user experience in various applications, such as mental health support systems or educational tools.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- Technical challenges in implementing active inference models.
- Limited user engagement if the interface is not intuitive.
- Ethical considerations in handling user emotional data.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
- Software and hardware costs for development and testing (estimated $5,000 - $10,000).
- Potential collaboration costs if external experts are involved.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- 1-3 months for development and initial testing.
- Additional 1-2 months for user testing and feedback incorporation.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint:** Successful integration of active inference models into the interface (after 1 month).
  - Evaluate the technical feasibility and initial user feedback.
- **Final Checkpoint:** User testing and feedback analysis (after 3-5 months).
  - Assess the overall user experience, emotional engagement, and system performance.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Enhancing Mirror Ritual with Active Inference

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Enhance the "Mirror Ritual" installation by integrating active inference principles to make it more interactive, emotionally responsive, and adaptive to user emotions.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
The current "Mirror Ritual" installation uses predefined emotional responses and lacks real-time adaptation. The limits include limited personalization and static emotional feedback.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will use active inference to enable the "Mirror Ritual" to dynamically adjust its emotional responses based on user interactions. This approach builds on Nina Rajcic's existing work and leverages her current learning in active inference to create a more engaging and emotionally intelligent installation.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success will make the "Mirror Ritual" a more powerful tool for emotional self-reflection, enhancing its impact in therapeutic, educational, and artistic contexts. It will also contribute to the development of more empathetic AI systems.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- Technical challenges in integrating active inference with existing infrastructure.
- User acceptance and engagement risks if the new features are not intuitive.
- Ethical considerations in handling and interpreting user emotional data.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
- Estimated $20,000 - $30,000 for software development, hardware upgrades, and testing.
- Potential collaboration costs with experts from psychology and neuroscience.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- 6-9 months for development and integration.
- Additional 3-6 months for user testing and feedback incorporation.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint:** Successful integration of active inference models (after 3-4 months).
  - Evaluate the technical feasibility and initial user feedback.
- **Final Checkpoint:** User testing and feedback analysis (after 9-12 months).
  - Assess the overall user experience, emotional engagement, and system performance.

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing an Active Inference Framework for Affective Computing Applications

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a comprehensive active inference framework specifically tailored for affective computing applications, including tools, methodologies, and guidelines for integrating active inference into various affective interfaces.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current affective computing applications lack a unified framework for incorporating active inference. The limits include fragmented approaches, limited scalability, and a lack of standardized methodologies.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will create a cohesive framework that integrates active inference with affective computing, providing a standardized approach for developers. This framework will leverage Nina Rajcic's expertise in affective computing and her deepening understanding of active inference to address the current limitations.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success will provide a universal framework that can be applied across various affective computing applications, enhancing their emotional intelligence and user engagement. This will impact a wide range of fields, including mental health, education, and human-computer interaction.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- Complexity in developing a comprehensive framework.
- Adoption challenges among developers and researchers.
- Ethical and societal implications of widespread use of AI simulating human emotions.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
- Estimated $50,000 - $100,000 for research, development, and testing.
- Potential funding from research grants or collaborations with industry partners.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- 1-2 years for framework development and initial testing.
- Additional 1-2 years for widespread adoption, user testing, and continuous improvement.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint:** Completion of the framework's core components (after 6-12 months).
  - Evaluate the technical feasibility, conduct initial user testing, and gather feedback.
- **Final Checkpoint:** Widespread adoption and long-term user testing (after 2-4 years).
  - Assess the overall impact, user acceptance, and the framework's performance across various applications.

### Potential Collaborators and Resources

- **Collaborators:** Researchers from neuroscience, psychology, and AI; experts from the Active Inference Institute.
- **Resources:** Active Inference community workshops, interdisciplinary research journals, collaborative projects involving multiple disciplines, and software tools like MATLAB or Python libraries (`pytorch`, `tensorflow`).
