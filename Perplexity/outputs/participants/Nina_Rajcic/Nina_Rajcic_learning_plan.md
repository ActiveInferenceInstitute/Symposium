### Personalized Learning Plan for Nina Rajcic: Active Inference

#### Immediate Next Steps (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Academic Papers:**
  - Start with the paper "The theory of constructed emotion: an active inference account of interoception and categorization"[2].
  - Review the references listed in the "Mirror Ritual" papers, particularly those related to active inference and emotional construction[2][4].

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
  - Understand the basic principles of active inference.
  - Grasp the concept of constructed emotion and its relation to interoception and categorization.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
  - Read and summarize the key points of the selected papers.
  - Join online forums or discussion groups related to active inference, such as the Active Inference community on Reddit or specialized groups on LinkedIn.
  - Set up a meeting or call with a colleague or mentor who has experience in active inference to discuss initial questions and gain insights.

#### Short-Term Goals (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
  - **Active Inference Framework:** Delve deeper into the mathematical and theoretical underpinnings of active inference.
  - **Emotion Construction:** Understand how emotions are constructed through interoception and categorization.
  - **Affective Interfaces:** Apply active inference to the design of affective interfaces, using examples from the "Mirror Ritual" project.

**Practical Exercises or Projects:**
  - **Simulation Projects:** Use software tools like MATLAB or Python libraries (e.g., `pytorch` or `tensorflow`) to simulate simple active inference models.
  - **Case Studies:** Analyze existing affective interfaces and evaluate how they could be improved using active inference principles.

**Recommended Study Materials:**
  - **Tutorials and Courses:**
    - The Active Inference Institute may offer tutorials or workshops; check their website for upcoming events.
    - Online courses on Coursera, edX, or Udemy that cover topics in computational neuroscience and affective computing.
  - **Books:**
    - "The Theory of Constructed Emotion" by Lisa Feldman Barrett.

**Community Engagement Opportunities:**
  - Attend webinars or online conferences focused on human-computer interaction, affective computing, and active inference.
  - Participate in hackathons or design challenges that involve creating affective interfaces.

#### Medium-Term Development (3-6 months)

**Advanced Topics to Explore:**
  - **Neural Mechanisms:** Study the neural mechanisms underlying active inference and emotion construction.
  - **Ethical Considerations:** Explore the ethical implications of creating artificial agents that simulate human emotions.

**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**
