### Personalized Learning Plan for Kristen Pavle: Applying Active Inference in Community Building

#### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Active Inference Institute Materials**: Begin with introductory resources from the Active Inference Institute, such as video lectures, blog posts, and introductory papers. For example, the Active Inference Lab's YouTube channel and their blog on the Friston Life website.
- **Academic Papers**: Read foundational papers on Active Inference, such as "The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory?" by Karl Friston.
- **Online Forums**: Engage with online communities like the Active Inference subreddit or relevant threads on ResearchGate.

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the basic principles of Active Inference, including the free-energy principle and how agents minimize surprise.
- Familiarize yourself with the concept of the "sensemaking stack" and where Active Inference fits within it.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Spend 2 hours per day for the next week reading introductory materials and watching video lectures.
- Join and participate in online forums to ask questions and get feedback from the community.
- Create a list of key terms and concepts related to Active Inference to review and expand upon.

#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Active Inference in Social Contexts**: Study how Active Inference can be applied to model group behavior and decision-making processes.
- **Dunbar Layers**: Understand how Active Inference can support different design affordances for groups of various sizes, aligning with Dunbar's social layer theory.
- **Sensemaking Stack**: Delve deeper into the sensemaking stack and its components to better integrate Active Inference into community building.

**Practical Exercises or Projects:**
- **Case Studies**: Analyze existing community projects and evaluate how Active Inference principles could be applied or have been applied.
- **Simulation Models**: Use software tools like MATLAB or Python to create simple simulations of social systems using Active Inference models.

**Recommended Study Materials:**
- **Books**: "The Free-Energy Principle: A Unified Brain Theory?" by Karl Friston (if available in book form) or similar texts that elaborate on Active Inference.
- **Workshops and Conferences**: Look for upcoming workshops or conferences focused on Active Inference and social sciences, such as those organized by the Active Inference Lab or related academic institutions.

**Community Engagement Opportunities:**
- **Webinars and Online Seminars**: Participate in webinars or online seminars hosted by institutions like the Active Inference Lab or related research groups.
- **Collaboration with Experts**: Reach out to researchers or practitioners who have applied Active Inference in community building for guidance and potential collaboration.

#### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)

**Advanced Topics to Explore:**
- **Hierarchical Object Representations**: Study advanced topics like hierarchical object representations and how they can be applied in social contexts, as discussed in papers like the thesis on compositional visual reasoning[1].
- **Task Decomposition**: Learn about task decomposition in the context of Active Inference, including the use of large language models (LLMs) as controllers.

**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**
- **Interdisciplinary Research Groups**: Join or collaborate with interdisciplinary research groups that combine cognitive science, social sciences, and computer science.
- **Community Building Projects**: Participate in or lead community building projects that incorporate Active Inference principles, potentially collaborating with experts from various fields.

**Application Projects in Their Domain:**
- **Designing Adaptive Community Structures**: Apply Active Inference to design and implement adaptive community structures, focusing on different Dunbar layers.
- **Evaluating Existing Communities**: Evaluate existing communities using Active Inference metrics to identify areas for improvement and optimize their coherence.

**Skill-Building Activities:**
- **Programming Skills**: Enhance programming skills in languages like Python or MATLAB to implement and simulate Active Inference models.
