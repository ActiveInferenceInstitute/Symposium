### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Applying Active Inference to Small-Scale Community Design

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create a small-scale community design using Active Inference principles to enhance coherence and decision-making within a group of around 100 people.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, community design often relies on traditional methods such as consensus-building meetings and hierarchical structures. However, these methods can be time-consuming, may not scale well, and can lead to decision-making bottlenecks. The limits include the lack of a systematic approach to minimize surprise and maintain internal models of the group, which can lead to inefficiencies and conflicts.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will apply Active Inference to model the behavior and decision-making processes of the group. By using the free-energy principle, the community can be designed to minimize surprise and maintain a coherent internal model. This approach is new because it integrates a theoretical framework from cognitive science into community building, potentially enhancing the group's ability to adapt and make decisions efficiently.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will make a significant difference to the community members by improving their decision-making processes, enhancing group cohesion, and reducing conflicts. It will also contribute to the theoretical development of Active Inference by providing a practical application in a social context.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Integration Complexity**: Integrating Active Inference into existing community structures could be challenging.
- **Limited Buy-In**: Members might resist new methods, especially if they are unfamiliar with the theoretical underpinnings.
- **Scalability Issues**: The model might not scale well if the group size increases.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The cost will be minimal, primarily involving time and resources for research and implementation. There may be some costs associated with software tools or workshops, but these are expected to be low.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take about 2-3 months to complete, including the initial research, design, implementation, and evaluation phases.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point (1 month):** Evaluate the initial design and gather feedback from the community.
- **Final Check Point (3 months):** Assess the overall impact on the community's decision-making and cohesion, and document the findings.

**Potential Collaborators/Resources:**
- **Active Inference Lab Resources:** Utilize introductory materials, video lectures, and online forums.
- **Community Building Experts:** Collaborate with experts in community building to ensure practical feasibility.
- **Software Tools:** Use MATLAB or Python for simulating and modeling Active Inference systems.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Developing Hierarchical Community Structures Using Active Inference

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a hierarchical community structure that leverages Active Inference to manage and coordinate activities across different Dunbar layers (e.g., 5, 15, 50, 150 people).

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, hierarchical structures in communities are often rigid and do not adapt well to changing conditions. They rely on manual coordination and can suffer from communication bottlenecks. The limits include the lack of a systematic approach to handle complexity and scale.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will use Active Inference to create adaptive hierarchical structures that can manage surprise and maintain coherence across different group sizes. By integrating hierarchical object representations and task decomposition, the community can be designed to be more resilient and efficient. This approach is new because it applies advanced Active Inference concepts to real-world community building.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success will significantly improve the scalability and adaptability of community structures, enhancing decision-making and reducing conflicts. It will also contribute to the theoretical development of Active Inference by providing empirical evidence of its application in complex social systems.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Complexity in Implementation:** Implementing hierarchical structures with Active Inference can be complex and require significant resources.
- **Scalability Challenges:** Ensuring the model scales effectively across different group sizes is a significant challenge.
- **Resistance to Change:** Community members might resist the introduction of new, more complex structures.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The cost will be moderate, involving time, resources for research, and potentially some software or consulting costs. Estimated costs could range from $5,000 to $20,000 depending on the scope and resources needed.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take about 6-9 months to complete, including the research, design, implementation, and evaluation phases.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point (3 months):** Evaluate the design and implementation of the hierarchical structure at the smaller scales (e.g., 5, 15 people).
- **Mid-term Check Point (6 months):** Assess the integration and coordination across different Dunbar layers.
- **Final Check Point (9 months):** Evaluate the overall impact on the community's adaptability and decision-making, and document the findings.

**Potential Collaborators/Resources:**
- **Active Inference Researchers:** Collaborate with researchers specializing in hierarchical object representations and task decomposition.
- **Community Building Experts:** Work with experts who have experience in designing and managing hierarchical community structures.
- **Software Tools:** Utilize advanced software tools like MATLAB or Python libraries for implementing and simulating the hierarchical Active Inference models.

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Scaling Active Inference for Large-Scale Community Building and Policy Impact

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and implement a large-scale community building framework using Active Inference principles that can be applied to communities of thousands of people, with the goal of influencing policy and social structures at a national or international level.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, large-scale community building and policy initiatives often lack a systematic theoretical framework to guide their design and operation. They rely heavily on empirical methods and may not effectively manage complexity or scale. The limits include the inability to maintain coherence and adaptability in large groups and the lack of a unified theoretical approach.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will apply Active Inference at a large scale, integrating advanced concepts such as hierarchical object representations, task decomposition, and sensemaking stack analysis. By doing so, it aims to create highly adaptive and coherent community structures that can influence policy and social change. This approach is new because it scales Active Inference to large, complex social systems, which has not been extensively done before.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success will have a profound impact on how large-scale communities are designed and managed, potentially leading to more efficient, adaptive, and coherent social structures. It will also contribute significantly to the theoretical development of Active Inference and its application in policy and social sciences.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Scalability and Complexity:** Scaling Active Inference to large communities is highly complex and risky.
- **Resistance from Stakeholders:** There may be significant resistance from policymakers and community leaders to adopt new, theoretically-driven approaches.
- **Resource Intensive:** This project will require substantial resources, including funding, personnel, and technological infrastructure.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The cost will be substantial, likely in the range of $100,000 to $500,000 or more, depending on the scope, resources needed, and the scale of implementation.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take about 1-2 years to complete, including the extensive research, design, implementation, and evaluation phases.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point (6 months):** Evaluate the theoretical framework and initial design.
- **Mid-term Check Point (12 months):** Assess the implementation and early results in smaller-scale pilot communities.
- **Final Check Point (18-24 months):** Evaluate the overall impact on large-scale community building and policy influence, and document the findings.

**Potential Collaborators/Resources:**
- **Interdisciplinary Research Groups:** Collaborate with researchers from cognitive science, social sciences, and computer science.
- **Policy Makers and Community Leaders:** Work closely with policymakers and community leaders to ensure the practical feasibility and acceptance of the framework.
- **Advanced Software Tools:** Utilize advanced software tools and frameworks for large-scale simulations and modeling.
- **Workshops and Conferences:** Participate in and present at conferences and workshops to gather feedback and validate the approach.
