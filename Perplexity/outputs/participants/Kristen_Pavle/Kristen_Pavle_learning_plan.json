Studies**: Analyze existing community projects and evaluate how Active Inference principles could be applied or have been applied.\n- **Simulation Models**: Use software tools like MATLAB or Python to create simple simulations of social systems using Active Inference models.\n\n**Recommended Study Materials:**\n- **Books**: \"The Free-Energy Principle: A Unified Brain Theory?\" by Karl Friston (if available in book form) or similar texts that elaborate on Active Inference.\n- **Workshops and Conferences**: Look for upcoming workshops or conferences focused on Active Inference and social sciences, such as those organized by the Active Inference Lab or related academic institutions.\n\n**Community Engagement Opportunities:**\n- **Webinars and Online Seminars**: Participate in webinars or online seminars hosted by institutions like the Active Inference Lab or related research groups.\n- **Collaboration with Experts**: Reach out to researchers or practitioners who have applied Active Inference in community building for guidance and potential collaboration.\n\n#### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)\n\n**Advanced Topics to Explore:**\n- **Hierarchical Object Representations**:

Decomposition**: Learn about task decomposition in the context of Active Inference, including the use of large language models (LLMs) as controllers.\n\n**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**\n- **Interdisciplinary Research Groups**: Join or collaborate with interdisciplinary research groups that combine cognitive science, social sciences, and computer science.\n- **Community Building Projects**: Participate in or lead community building projects that incorporate Active Inference principles, potentially collaborating with experts from various fields.\n\n**Application Projects in Their Domain:**\n- **Designing Adaptive Community Structures**: Apply Active Inference to design and implement adaptive community structures, focusing on different Dunbar layers.\n- **Evaluating Existing Communities**: Evaluate existing communities using Active Inference metrics to identify areas for improvement and optimize their coherence.\n\n**Skill-Building Activities:**\n- **Programming Skills**: Enhance programming skills in languages like Python or MATLAB to implement and simulate Active Inference models.\n- **Workshops and Training**: Attend advanced workshops or training programs
