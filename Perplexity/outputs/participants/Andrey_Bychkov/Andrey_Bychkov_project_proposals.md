### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Active Inference for Predictive Maintenance in Simple Systems

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and implement a simple Active Inference model to predict the maintenance needs of a basic mechanical system, such as a pump or a motor, to reduce downtime and improve overall system reliability.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, predictive maintenance often relies on traditional statistical methods or basic machine learning algorithms that do not fully incorporate the dynamic and uncertain nature of complex systems. These methods can be limited by their inability to handle high-dimensional data and to adapt to changing system conditions.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
The new approach involves using Active Inference to model the system's behavior, incorporating Bayesian inference to handle uncertainty and control theory to optimize system performance. This method can adapt to changing conditions and provide more accurate predictions by continuously updating the model based on new data.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will make a significant difference to maintenance teams and system operators by reducing unexpected downtime, lowering maintenance costs, and improving the overall reliability of the system. This can be particularly beneficial in industries such as manufacturing, where equipment reliability is crucial.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of implementing Active Inference models, the need for high-quality data, and the potential for model drift if the system's behavior changes significantly over time.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project will require minimal costs, primarily related to software tools (e.g., MATLAB, PyTorch) and potentially some consulting or training expenses to ensure proper implementation of Active Inference.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 1-2 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the system and the availability of data.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: After 4-6 weeks, evaluate the initial model's performance on a small dataset to ensure it is capturing the system's behavior accurately.
- **Final Check Point**: After 2 months, deploy the model in a real-world setting and monitor its performance over a few weeks to assess its predictive accuracy and impact on maintenance schedules.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with Digital Pathology for Tumor Detection

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop an Active Inference-based framework to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of tumor detection in digital pathology images, leveraging the participant's background in complex systems reliability and interest in interdisciplinary applications.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current methods in digital pathology often use deep learning models (e.g., CNNs) for tumor detection, which can be computationally intensive and may not fully leverage the contextual information within whole slide images (WSIs)[2][3]. These methods can be limited by their reliance on large, annotated datasets and the potential for false positives or negatives.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
The new approach involves integrating Active Inference with deep learning models to create a more adaptive and context-aware system. Active Inference can help in optimizing the search for tumor regions within WSIs, reducing the computational load and improving the accuracy of detection by incorporating prior knowledge and uncertainty.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will significantly impact the field of digital pathology by providing a more efficient and accurate method for tumor detection, which can lead to better patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of integrating Active Inference with deep learning models, the need for high-quality annotated datasets, and the potential for overfitting or model drift.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project will require moderate costs, including software and computational resources (e.g., GPUs), potential consulting fees for pathology experts, and possibly access to large datasets.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 3-6 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the integration and the availability of datasets.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: After 2 months, evaluate the performance of the integrated model on a validation dataset to ensure it is outperforming current methods.
- **Final Check Point**: After 6 months, conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance on a large, diverse dataset and gather feedback from pathologists to assess its clinical utility.

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing a Scalable Active Inference Framework for Complex Systems Reliability

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a scalable and robust Active Inference framework that can be applied to complex, high-dimensional systems in various industries, such as energy, transportation, or healthcare, to predict and optimize system reliability.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current reliability engineering practices often use traditional statistical models or basic machine learning techniques that are not designed to handle the complexity and uncertainty of modern systems. These methods are limited by their inability to scale to high-dimensional data and to adapt to dynamic system conditions.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
The new approach involves developing a hierarchical Active Inference framework that can handle high-dimensional data by decomposing the system into manageable components. This framework will incorporate advanced Bayesian methods and control theory to optimize system performance and adapt to changing conditions.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will make a significant impact across various industries by providing a powerful tool for predicting and optimizing system reliability, leading to reduced downtime, lower maintenance costs, and improved overall system performance.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the high complexity of the project, the need for large, diverse datasets, and the potential for scalability issues as the system grows.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project will require significant costs, including advanced software and computational resources (e.g., distributed computing architectures), consulting fees for experts in reliability engineering and Bayesian methods, and potentially collaborations with industry partners.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 1-2 years to complete, depending on the complexity of the system and the availability of resources.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: After 6 months, evaluate the performance of the initial framework on a smaller-scale system to ensure it is capturing the system's behavior accurately.
- **Mid-term Check Point 2**: After 1 year, deploy the framework in a real-world setting on a medium-scale system and monitor its performance over several months to assess its predictive accuracy and impact on system reliability.
- **Final Check Point**: After 2 years, conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the framework's performance on a large, complex system and gather feedback from industry partners to assess its practical utility and scalability.
