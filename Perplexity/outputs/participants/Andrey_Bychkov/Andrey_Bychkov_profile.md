Given the limited information provided about Andrey Bychkov, the analysis will be cautious and focused on the available details.

## Background Analysis: Expertise and Experience
Since the background and affiliation of Andrey Bychkov are not provided, it is challenging to determine his specific expertise and experience. However, his involvement in "Complex systems reliability research" suggests that he may have a strong foundation in engineering, physics, or a related field where complex systems are a focus. Without additional details, it is uncertain whether he has a background in machine learning, computational methods, or other relevant areas that could intersect with Active Inference.

## Active Inference Journey: Current Understanding and Application Stage
Andrey Bychkov is currently applying Active Inference to complex systems reliability research. Active Inference is a theoretical framework that combines concepts from Bayesian inference and control theory to explain how agents make decisions and interact with their environment. In the context of complex systems reliability, Active Inference could be used to model and predict the behavior of these systems, optimize their performance, and manage risks.

Given this application, it is likely that Bychkov has a basic to intermediate understanding of Active Inference principles and their mathematical underpinnings. However, without more specific details, it is difficult to assess his depth of knowledge or the stage of his research.
