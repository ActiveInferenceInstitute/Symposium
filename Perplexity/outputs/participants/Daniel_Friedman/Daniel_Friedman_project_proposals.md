### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Active Inference in Ant Colony Behavior

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Apply active inference models to understand and predict the behavior of ant colonies, focusing on foraging patterns and collective decision-making.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current research on ant colony behavior often relies on empirical observations and traditional modeling techniques such as agent-based models or statistical analyses. However, these methods may not fully capture the complex interactions and adaptive behaviors of ants. The limits include the lack of a unified framework that integrates perception, action, and decision-making.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will use active inference, a Bayesian framework that unifies perception and action by minimizing free energy. By applying active inference models, we can better understand how ants predict their environment, make decisions, and adapt to changes. This approach is new because it integrates the free energy principle with the existing knowledge of ant behavior, providing a more comprehensive and mechanistic understanding.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Entomologists, ecologists, and researchers in collective behavior will benefit from this project. It will provide a novel framework for understanding complex social behaviors in insects, which can have implications for agriculture, conservation, and biologically inspired robotics.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risk is the complexity of implementing active inference models, which may require significant computational resources and mathematical expertise. Additionally, there is a risk that the models may not accurately capture the nuanced behaviors of ants.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will primarily require computational resources and access to existing datasets on ant behavior. The cost will be minimal, largely consisting of software licenses and potential travel to workshops or conferences.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take 1-3 months, depending on the complexity of the models and the availability of data.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point:** After 1 month, evaluate the initial model implementations and compare them with existing empirical data.
- **Final Check Point:** After 3 months, present the findings at a workshop or symposium and receive feedback from peers.

**Technical Details and Methodologies:**
- Use MATLAB or Python to implement discrete-state-space active inference models.
- Utilize existing datasets on ant foraging behavior.
- Collaborate with entomologists and active inference experts to ensure the models are biologically plausible.

**Potential Collaborators or Resources:**
- Karl Friston for guidance on active inference models.
- Entomology departments for access to datasets and biological expertise.
- Active Inference Institute for computational resources and peer review.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Enhancing Population-Based Search with Active Inference

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Integrate active inference into population-based metaheuristics, such as Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), to enhance their performance through anticipatory environmental adaptation.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current population-based metaheuristics like ACO rely on reactive environmental interactions without anticipatory adaptation. This limits their efficiency in complex and dynamic environments.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will integrate active inference into these metaheuristics, allowing agents to predict and actively minimize sensory discrepancies. This approach is new because it combines the probabilistic predictive capabilities of active inference with the search efficiency of population-based methods.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Researchers and practitioners in optimization, machine learning, and operations research will benefit. This integration can improve the performance of various optimization algorithms, leading to better solutions in fields like logistics, scheduling, and resource allocation.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risks include the computational complexity of integrating active inference with existing algorithms and the potential for increased overhead that might negate the performance gains.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The cost will be moderate, involving software licenses, potential travel to workshops, and possibly hiring a research assistant.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take 3-6 months, depending on the complexity of the integration and the availability of computational resources.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point:** After 3 months, evaluate the initial integration and compare the performance with traditional ACO.
- **Final Check Point:** After 6 months, publish the results in a conference or journal and present at a relevant symposium.

**Technical Details and Methodologies:**
- Implement active inference models using Python or MATLAB.
- Use existing ACO implementations as a baseline.
- Conduct experiments on benchmark problems like the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).

**Potential Collaborators or Resources:**
- Nassim Dehouche for guidance on integrating active inference with metaheuristics.
- Active Inference Institute for computational resources and peer review.
- Optimization research groups for access to benchmark problems and expertise.

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Active Inference for Cognitive Security in Organizational Design

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and implement active inference-based models for cognitive security in organizational design, focusing on mitigating cognitive biases and enhancing team performance.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current approaches to cognitive security and organizational design often rely on static models and do not fully account for the dynamic and adaptive nature of human perception and action. The limits include the lack of a unified framework that integrates perception, cognition, and action in real-time.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will use active inference to model how team members perceive reality and make decisions, allowing for the development of more effective strategies to mitigate cognitive biases and enhance teamwork. This approach is new because it leverages the free energy principle to create adaptive and predictive models of human behavior in organizational contexts.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Organizations, particularly those in high-stakes environments like defense, finance, and healthcare, will benefit significantly. This project can lead to improved decision-making, reduced cognitive biases, and enhanced team performance.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risks include the complexity of applying active inference to human behavior, the need for extensive data collection, and the potential resistance to adopting new methodologies within organizations.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The cost will be substantial, involving significant computational resources, potential hiring of research assistants, and collaboration with organizational psychologists and security experts.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take 6-12 months, depending on the scope of the implementation and the availability of resources.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point:** After 6 months, evaluate the initial model implementations and conduct pilot studies within organizations.
