### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Implementing Simple Active Inference Models for Ant Colony Behavior

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create and implement simple active inference models to simulate and understand the behavior of ant colonies, leveraging Daniel Friedman's background in entomology.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, ant colony behavior is often modeled using traditional swarm intelligence algorithms or simple rule-based systems. However, these models lack the integrated perception-action framework that active inference provides. The limits of current practice include the inability to capture the complex interactions between perception, cognition, and action in a unified manner.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will apply the active inference framework to model ant colony behavior, integrating perception (sensing the environment), cognition (predicting and updating beliefs), and action (foraging and communication). This approach is new because it uses a probabilistic, Bayesian framework to minimize free energy, which can more accurately capture the adaptive and anticipatory nature of ant colonies. Success is expected due to the inherent scalability and flexibility of active inference models.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Researchers in biology, ecology, and artificial intelligence will benefit from this project. Understanding ant colony behavior through active inference can provide insights into collective behavior, distributed decision-making, and environmental adaptation. This could lead to better models for swarm intelligence and bio-inspired algorithms.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risks include the complexity of implementing active inference models, the need for significant computational resources, and the challenge of validating the models against real-world data.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project will require minimal costs, primarily related to computational resources and potential collaboration with other researchers. No significant hardware or software investments are anticipated.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 2-3 months, given the focus on a well-defined and relatively simple system like ant colonies.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: Successful implementation of a basic active inference model for a small-scale ant colony simulation (1 month).
- **Final Check Point**: Validation of the model against empirical data on ant colony behavior and presentation of findings in a research paper or poster (2-3 months).

**Potential Collaborators/Resources**:
- **Karl Friston**: For theoretical guidance on active inference.
- **Active Inference Lab**: For access to resources, discussions, and potential collaboration with other researchers.
- **MATLAB Code for Discrete-State-Space Active Inference**: From the FEP and Active Inference Paper Repository.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Enhancing Online Team Performance Using Active Inference

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and implement active inference models to enhance the performance and dynamics of online teams, focusing on improving communication, decision-making, and cognitive biases mitigation.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, online team performance is often managed using traditional team management tools and strategies. However, these approaches do not fully account for the complex perceptual and cognitive processes involved in team dynamics. The limits include the lack of a unified framework that integrates perception, action, and cognition.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will apply active inference to model how team members perceive reality, make decisions, and interact. By using probabilistic models to predict and minimize sensory discrepancies, the approach can help teams mitigate cognitive biases, improve situation awareness, and enhance overall performance. Success is anticipated due to the ability of active inference to capture the dynamic and adaptive nature of team interactions.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Organizations and teams operating in digital environments will benefit significantly. Improved team performance can lead to better decision-making, enhanced collaboration, and reduced errors due to cognitive biases.

#### 5. What are the risks?
Risks include the complexity of modeling human perception and cognition, the need for extensive data collection, and the potential resistance to adopting new methodologies within existing teams.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project will require moderate costs, including funding for data collection tools, potential software development, and collaboration with organizational behavior experts.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 6-9 months, considering the need for data collection, model development, and validation.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: Successful development of a preliminary active inference model for online team dynamics and initial validation with a small team (3 months).
- **Final Check Point**: Full-scale implementation and validation of the model with multiple teams, followed by a comprehensive report and potential publication (6-9 months).

**Potential Collaborators/Resources**:
- **Organizational Behavior Experts**: For insights into team dynamics and organizational design.
- **Active Inference Lab**: For access to resources, discussions, and potential collaboration with other researchers.
- **Active Inference Institute**: For guidance on applying active inference in organizational contexts.

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Integrating Active Inference with Deep Learning for Complex Decision-Making

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop an integrated framework that combines active inference with deep learning to enhance decision-making in complex, dynamic environments, such as those encountered in cognitive security or autonomous systems.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, decision-making in complex environments often relies on either traditional rule-based systems or deep learning models. However, these approaches lack the integrated perception-action framework and the anticipatory adaptation provided by active inference. The limits include the inability to seamlessly integrate perception, cognition, and action in a scalable manner.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will integrate deep neural networks with active inference to create agents that can learn environmental dynamics efficiently while maintaining task performance. The approach will use techniques such as Monte-Carlo tree search, habitual networks, and Monte-Carlo dropouts to optimize policy selection and state transition precision. Success is expected due to the synergy between the predictive capabilities of deep learning and the adaptive, anticipatory nature of active inference.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Researchers and practitioners in fields such as cognitive security, autonomous systems, and artificial intelligence will benefit significantly. This integrated framework can lead to more robust, adaptive, and efficient decision-making systems that can handle complex, dynamic environments.

#### 5. What are the risks?
Risks include the high complexity of integrating deep learning with active inference, the need for significant computational resources, and the challenge of validating the models against real-world data.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project will require substantial costs, including funding for advanced computational resources, potential software development, and collaboration with experts in deep learning and active inference.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 1-2 years, considering the complexity of the integration, the need for extensive testing, and the validation process.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: Successful integration of deep learning with active inference in a simplified environment and initial validation results (6 months).
