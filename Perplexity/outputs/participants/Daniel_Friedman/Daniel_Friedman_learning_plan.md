### Learning Plan for Daniel Friedman on Active Inference

#### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Podcast and Video Interviews:**
  - Listen to the podcast "From Ants to Active Inference with Daniel Ari Friedman" to refresh and deepen your understanding of the foundational concepts and their application to complex systems[2].
  - Watch the YouTube interview "What is Active Inference?...with Daniel Friedman" to get a concise overview of active inference and its integration with various cognitive processes[5].

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Revisit the core principles of active inference, including the free energy principle, predictive processing, and the integration of perception, cognition, and action.
- Understand the current state of active inference research and its applications.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Review the key papers listed in the FEP and Active Inference Paper Repository, particularly the tutorials and foundational papers by Karl Friston and other prominent researchers[4].
- Join the Active Inference Lab's co-creative space to engage with other participants and stay updated on the latest discussions and projects[5].

#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Discrete, Continuous, and Deep Active Inference:**
  - Study the different strands of active inference, including discrete-state-space, continuous-time, and deep active inference models[4].
- **Free Energy Principle and Variational Inference:**
  - Delve into the mathematical basis of the Free Energy Principle and its application in variational inference. Use resources like "A Step-by-Step Tutorial on Active Inference and its Application to Empirical Data" by Ryan Smith and Karl Friston[4].

**Practical Exercises or Projects:**
- **Implementation of Active Inference Models:**
  - Follow the detailed walkthrough of discrete-state-space active inference and implement a sample model using MATLAB code provided in the tutorials[4].
  - Explore the neural architecture for building deep active inference agents as described by Tetsuya Ogata in the 4th International Workshop on Active Inference[3].

**Recommended Study Materials:**
- **Academic Papers:**
  - Read "A free energy principle for biological systems" by Karl Friston and "Attention, uncertainty, and free-energy" by Harriet Feldman and Karl Friston[4].
- **Tutorials and Workshops:**
  - Participate in or review the materials from the 4th International Workshop on Active Inference, particularly the sessions on embodied AI and deep active inference[3].

**Community Engagement Opportunities:**
- **Active Inference Institute Events:**
  - Attend or follow the Applied Active Inference Symposium and other events organized by the Active Inference Institute to engage with researchers and practitioners[3][5].
- **Online Forums and Groups:**
  - Engage in discussions on forums related to active inference, such as the Active Inference Labâ€™s online community, to exchange ideas and learn from others.

#### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)

**Advanced Topics to Explore:**
- **Multi-Agent Active Inference:**
  - Dive into the application of active inference in multi-agent systems, including shared protentions and distributed science initiatives[4].
- **Cognitive Security and Organizational Design:**
  - Explore how active inference can be applied to cognitive security and organizational design, leveraging your background in these areas[3][5].

**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**
- **Interdisciplinary Projects:**
  - Collaborate with researchers from biology, neuroscience, and computer science on projects that integrate active inference with other frameworks. For example, work with Karl Friston or other key figures on integrating active inference with SUMO ontology[4].
