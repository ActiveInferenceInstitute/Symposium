### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with Attachment Theory in Clinical Case Studies

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
This project aims to apply the principles of Active Inference to understand and analyze clinical case studies involving attachment disorders. The goal is to use Active Inference to explain the behavioral and emotional responses of individuals with attachment issues and to explore how this framework can inform therapeutic interventions.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, attachment disorders are analyzed and treated using traditional psychological theories such as attachment theory and mentalization. However, these approaches often lack a unified, neurobiologically grounded framework that can explain the complex interactions between the individual's internal state and their environment. The limits of current practice include the lack of a mechanistic understanding of how attachment behaviors are generated and maintained, and the limited predictive power of existing models.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
The new approach involves using Active Inference to model the predictive processing and free-energy minimization that underlie attachment behaviors. By framing attachment as an active inference process, we can better understand how individuals with attachment disorders perceive and interact with their environment, and how they update their internal models based on sensory inputs. This approach is expected to be successful because it provides a biologically plausible and mathematically rigorous framework for understanding complex behavioral phenomena.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will make a significant difference for clinicians and researchers working with attachment disorders. It will provide a new, theoretically grounded approach to understanding and treating these disorders, potentially leading to more effective therapeutic interventions. It will also contribute to the broader integration of Active Inference into clinical psychology, enhancing our understanding of human behavior and cognition.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of integrating Active Inference with existing clinical practices, the need for interdisciplinary collaboration, and the potential for initial resistance from clinicians unfamiliar with the Active Inference framework.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The costs will be minimal, primarily involving time and resources for literature review, case study analysis, and potential collaboration with other researchers. No significant financial investment is required.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take 1-2 months to complete, depending on the availability of case studies and the depth of analysis.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Weekly Review**: Regularly review the progress of case study analysis and note any challenges or insights.
- **Monthly Checkpoint**: Complete the analysis of at least two case studies and draft a preliminary report.
- **Final Report**: Submit a comprehensive report detailing the application of Active Inference to attachment disorders, including implications for therapeutic interventions.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Developing Active Inference-Based Interventions for Trauma

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
This project aims to develop and test Active Inference-based interventions for individuals with trauma. The goal is to create therapeutic strategies that leverage the predictive processing framework to help individuals better manage their internal states and interact with their environment in a more adaptive way.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, trauma interventions often rely on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), and other evidence-based practices. However, these methods may not fully address the underlying neurobiological mechanisms driving traumatic responses. The limits include the lack of a unified theoretical framework that explains how traumatic experiences affect internal models and behavior.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
The new approach involves designing interventions based on Active Inference, focusing on reducing the "pervasive surprise" associated with traumatic experiences. By helping individuals update their internal models and improve their predictive processing, these interventions aim to reduce the impact of trauma on daily life. This approach is expected to be successful because it offers a mechanistic understanding of how traumatic experiences alter perception and behavior, and provides a principled way to address these changes.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will significantly impact the field of trauma psychology by providing novel, theoretically grounded interventions. It will make a difference for clinicians, researchers, and most importantly, individuals suffering from trauma, by offering more effective and personalized therapeutic strategies.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The risks include the complexity of translating theoretical models into practical interventions, the need for robust empirical validation, and potential ethical considerations in working with vulnerable populations.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The costs will involve resources for literature review, intervention design, pilot studies, and potential collaboration with other researchers. This may include funding for participant recruitment and data analysis.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take 3-6 months to complete, depending on the scope of the intervention design and the availability of participants for pilot studies.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Monthly Workshops**: Conduct monthly workshops with the research team to discuss progress and address challenges.
- **Pilot Study Completion**: Complete pilot studies within 3 months and analyze preliminary data.
- **Final Intervention Design**: Finalize the intervention design based on pilot study results and prepare for larger-scale implementation.

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Integrating Active Inference with Educational Initiatives for Early Socioemotional Development

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
This project aims to integrate Active Inference into educational initiatives focused on early socioemotional development. The goal is to develop and implement curricula and interventions that use the predictive processing framework to enhance socioemotional learning and resilience in children.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, early socioemotional development programs rely on a variety of educational and therapeutic approaches, but these often lack a unified, neurobiologically grounded framework. The limits include the lack of a mechanistic understanding of how children develop socioemotional skills and the limited scalability of existing interventions.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
The new approach involves using Active Inference to design educational curricula that focus on enhancing children's predictive processing and free-energy minimization skills. By teaching children to better predict and adapt to their environment, these interventions aim to improve their socioemotional development and resilience. This approach is expected to be successful because it provides a biologically plausible and mathematically rigorous framework for understanding and enhancing socioemotional learning.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will have a profound impact on educational practices and socioemotional development programs. It will make a significant difference for educators, policymakers, and most importantly, children, by providing innovative and effective strategies to enhance socioemotional learning and resilience.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The risks include the complexity of integrating a new theoretical framework into existing educational systems, the need for extensive empirical validation, and potential challenges in scaling up the interventions.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The costs will be substantial, involving resources for curriculum development, teacher training, large-scale implementation, and extensive empirical validation. Funding will be required for participant recruitment, data analysis, and potential collaborations with educational institutions.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take 1-2 years to complete, depending on the scope of the curriculum development, the extent of the empirical validation, and the complexity of the implementation process.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Quarterly Meetings**: Conduct quarterly meetings with the research team and educational partners to discuss progress and address challenges.
- **Pilot Implementation**: Complete pilot implementations within 6 months and analyze preliminary data.
- **Large-Scale Implementation**: Finalize the curriculum and begin large-scale implementation after 1 year, with ongoing evaluation and refinement.
- **Final Evaluation**: Conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the program's effectiveness after 2 years, including long-term follow-up studies to assess the lasting impact on socioemotional development.
