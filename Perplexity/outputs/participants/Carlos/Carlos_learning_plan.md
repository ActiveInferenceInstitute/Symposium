### Personalized Learning Plan for Carlos Pitillas: Integrating Active Inference with Developmental and Clinical Psychology

#### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Video Introduction:** Start with the YouTube video "Active Inference Insights 001 ~ Free Energy Principle" featuring Karl Friston. This video provides a non-specialized introduction to active inference and the free energy principle, which is essential for bridging the gap between AI and psychology[2].
- **Foundational Paper:** Read the paper "Active inference and learning" to understand the distinction between goal-directed and habitual behavior, and how active inference accounts for choice behavior and learning[3].

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the basics of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and its application in active inference.
- Grasp the difference between goal-directed and habitual behavior in the context of active inference.
- Recognize how active inference integrates with Bayesian inference and predictive processing.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Watch the YouTube video "Active Inference Insights 001 ~ Free Energy Principle" and take notes on key concepts.
- Read the paper "Active inference and learning" and summarize the main points.
- Join the Active Inference Institute's Twitter account and engage with the community by asking questions or sharing insights[2].

#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Predictive Processing Framework (PPF):** Deepen understanding of PPF and its relationship with active inference.
- **Epistemic and Pragmatic Behavior:** Understand how epistemic (ambiguity-resolving) and pragmatic (reward-seeking) behaviors are integrated in active inference.
- **Belief Updating:** Learn about variational belief updating and its implications for psychological theories.

**Practical Exercises or Projects:**
- **Case Studies:** Analyze case studies that integrate PPF with developmental psychology (e.g., attachment theory) and clinical psychology (e.g., trauma studies). Create a report on how active inference can be applied in these contexts.
- **Simulation Models:** Use computational tools (e.g., Python libraries) to simulate simple active inference models. This can be done using resources from the Neuromatch Academy or the Computational Psychiatry course[4].

**Recommended Study Materials:**
- **Textbook:** Use "Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms" by David MacKay for detailed information on information theory and Bayesian inference[4].
- **Courses:**
  - Enroll in the Computational Psychiatry course, which includes lectures by Karl Friston and covers the computational basis of psychiatric disorders[4].
  - Participate in the Neuromatch Academy's summer school, focusing on computational neuroscience and deep learning[4].

**Community Engagement Opportunities:**
- **Active Inference Institute:** Engage with the Active Inference Institute's community through their website and social media channels. Participate in discussions and ask for feedback on your projects[2].
- **Online Forums:** Join online forums such as Reddit's r/Neuroscience and r/MachineLearning to discuss active inference and its applications.

#### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)

**Advanced Topics to Explore:**
- **Hybrid Active Inference Models:** Study the paper "Learning in Hybrid Active Inference Models" to understand how discrete and continuous variables are integrated in decision-making processes[5].
- **Hierarchical Active Inference:** Explore how hierarchical models can be used to specify abstract sub-goals and enhance exploration and planning[5].

**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**
- **Interdisciplinary Research Groups:** Collaborate with researchers from neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and clinical psychology to integrate active inference into various therapeutic contexts.
- **Workshops and Conferences:** Attend workshops or conferences focused on computational psychiatry and active inference, such as the Computational Neuroscience ‘Imbizo’ in Muizenburg, South Africa[4].

**Application Projects in Their Domain:**
- **Trauma Studies:** Develop a project that applies active inference to understand and treat relational trauma. This could involve designing and testing hypotheses about how predictive processing affects trauma recovery.
- **Attachment Theory:** Use active inference to model attachment relationships and develop interventions based on the principles of active inference.

**Skill-Building Activities:**
- **Programming Skills:** Enhance Python programming skills to implement and simulate active inference models. Use libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow.
- **Mathematical Foundations:** Deepen understanding of the mathematical underpinnings of active inference, including variational inference and free energy minimization.

#### SPECIFIC RESOURCES
