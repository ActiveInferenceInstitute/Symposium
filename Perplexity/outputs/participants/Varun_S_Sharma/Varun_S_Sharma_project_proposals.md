### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Implementing a Simple Active Inference Model for Single Cell Biology

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create a simple Active Inference model to simulate and predict the behavior of single cells in a biological system.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, Active Inference models are often complex and require significant computational resources. The limits include the difficulty in scaling these models to higher-order biological systems and the lack of straightforward implementation guides for beginners. Existing models often rely on complex mathematical formulations that can be daunting for new researchers.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will utilize PyTorch and Jax to implement a simplified Active Inference model specifically tailored for single cell biology. The approach will involve:
- Using pre-existing tutorials and repositories (e.g., [Active Inference Tutorial Repository]) as a starting point.
- Simplifying the model to focus on key variables and interactions relevant to single cell biology.
- Implementing data-driven Markov blanket discovery to reduce the complexity of the model.

The success of this approach is anticipated due to the use of well-documented libraries (PyTorch and Jax) and the focus on a specific, manageable scope (single cell biology).

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will provide a clear, step-by-step guide for implementing Active Inference models in single cell biology, making it more accessible to researchers new to the field. This will facilitate the adoption of Active Inference in various biological research contexts.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risks include the potential complexity of even simplified Active Inference models and the need for accurate data to validate the model. Additionally, there is a risk that the simplified model may not capture all the nuances of the biological system.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will not require significant financial resources, as it will rely on open-source libraries (PyTorch and Jax) and publicly available data.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take approximately 1-2 weeks to complete, considering the focus on a simplified model and the use of existing resources.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Week 1:** Complete the introductory tutorials on PyTorch and Jax, and review key papers on Active Inference.
- **Week 2:** Implement the simplified Active Inference model and run initial simulations.
- **Final Check Point:** Validate the model using real or synthetic data and document the process for future researchers.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Scaling Active Inference Models to Tissue Level Set Points

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and implement an Active Inference model that can be scaled to higher-order tissue level set points, enabling the simulation and prediction of tissue morphogenesis.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, scaling Active Inference models to tissue level is challenging due to the complexity of data-driven Markov blanket discovery and the partitioning of sensory, active, and internal variable states. Existing models are often limited to single cell or small-scale biological systems.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will involve:
- Advanced techniques for data-driven Markov blanket discovery using machine learning algorithms.
- Integration of Active Inference with other machine learning frameworks to enhance scalability.
- Collaboration with researchers from the Bock Lab and Menche Lab to leverage network-based approaches to biological systems.

The success of this approach is anticipated due to the combination of advanced computational methods, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the use of scalable machine learning frameworks.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will significantly advance the field of Active Inference by providing a scalable model for tissue-level biological systems. This will enable researchers to simulate and predict complex biological processes, such as tissue morphogenesis, more accurately.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risks include the complexity of scaling the model, the need for large datasets to validate the model, and potential challenges in integrating different machine learning frameworks.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project may require some financial resources for accessing large datasets or computational resources, but it will primarily rely on existing infrastructure and open-source libraries.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take approximately 3-6 months to complete, considering the complexity of scaling the model and the need for validation.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Month 1:** Complete the literature review and initial implementation of advanced Markov blanket discovery methods.
- **Month 2-3:** Integrate the Active Inference model with other machine learning frameworks and start scaling the model to tissue level.
- **Month 4-6:** Validate the model using real or synthetic data and document the process for future researchers.
- **Final Check Point:** Present the findings and the scaled model at a relevant conference or workshop.

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing an Integrated Active Inference Framework for Single Cell and Tissue Biology with Advanced Data Visualization

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create a comprehensive and integrated Active Inference framework that can be applied to both single cell and tissue-level biological systems, accompanied by advanced data visualization tools using virtual reality (VR) and traditional visualization methods.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, Active Inference models are often fragmented between single cell and tissue-level applications, and data visualization is typically limited to 2D or 3D static representations. The limits include the lack of a unified framework and the absence of immersive and interactive visualization tools.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will involve:
- Developing a unified Active Inference framework that integrates single cell and tissue-level models.
- Implementing advanced data visualization techniques using VR and traditional tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Collaborating with data visualization experts and computational biologists to ensure the framework is both theoretically sound and practically useful.
- Using PyTorch and Jax to ensure scalability and efficiency.

The success of this approach is anticipated due to the interdisciplinary collaboration, the use of advanced computational and visualization tools, and the creation of a unified framework.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will revolutionize the field of Active Inference by providing a cohesive and scalable framework for simulating and predicting biological processes at both single cell and tissue levels. The advanced data visualization tools will enhance the interpretability and usability of the models, making them more accessible to a broader range of researchers.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risks include the complexity of integrating different levels of biological systems, the need for significant computational resources, and the challenge of creating effective and intuitive data visualization tools.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require substantial financial resources for accessing advanced computational infrastructure, VR equipment, and potentially hiring additional personnel for interdisciplinary collaboration.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take approximately 1-2 years to complete, considering the scope and complexity of the tasks involved.
