  "content": "### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Active Inference for Single Cell Transcriptomics Modeling\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nDevelop and apply a simple Active Inference model to simulate and predict the behavior of single cells based on transcriptomics data.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrently, single cell transcriptomics data is often analyzed using traditional machine learning and statistical methods, which may not fully capture the dynamic and adaptive nature of cellular behavior. These methods lack the integrative and predictive capabilities that Active Inference offers, particularly in modeling the sensory, active, and internal states of cells.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project introduces Active Inference to model single cell behavior, integrating Markov blanket discovery and state partitionings. By using PyTorch or Jax to implement these models, we can leverage existing deep learning frameworks to enhance the scalability and interpretability of the models. The approach is new because it applies Active Inference principles to directly model the adaptive processes in single cells, which could provide more accurate predictions and insights into cellular behavior.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nSuccess in this project will make a significant difference in the field of single cell biology and transcriptomics. It will provide researchers with a novel framework to understand and predict cellular responses to various conditions, which can be crucial for drug discovery, personalized medicine, and understanding disease mechanisms.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\nThe primary risks include the technical challenges of integrating Active Inference with deep learning frameworks and the potential for overfitting or poor model generalization. Additionally, there may be limitations in the availability and quality of the transcriptomics data.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThis project is expected to be low-cost, primarily requiring computational resources and access to existing datasets. There may be some costs associated with attending workshops or courses to enhance skills in Active Inference and deep learning.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\nThis project is expected to take approximately 1-3 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the model and the availability of data.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Mid-term Checkpoints:**\n  - Completion of a literature review on Active Inference and its applications in biology (1 week).\n  - Implementation of a basic Active Inference model using PyTorch or Jax (2-3 weeks).\n  - Initial validation of the model on a small dataset (2-3 weeks).\n- **Final Checkpoints:**\n  - Completion of the full model implementation and validation on a larger dataset (1-2 months).\n  - Presentation of the results in a research seminar or workshop.\n\n### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Scaling Active Inference Models for Tissue Morphogenesis\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nDevelop and scale Active Inference models to simulate and predict tissue morphogenesis, integrating data from multiple cellular levels.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrently, tissue morphogenesis is modeled using various computational approaches, but these often lack the integrative and adaptive capabilities of Active Inference. Existing models may not fully capture the dynamic interactions between cells and their environment, leading to limitations in predicting complex tissue behaviors.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project will scale Active Inference models from single cells to tissue levels by integrating advanced Markov blanket discovery and multi-scale modeling techniques. By leveraging deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and Jax, and potentially incorporating Graph Neural Networks or VQ-VAE, the project aims to create more accurate and scalable models of tissue morphogenesis. The new approach involves applying Active Inference principles to model the complex interactions and adaptivity in tissue development.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nSuccess in this project will significantly impact the fields of developmental biology, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. It will provide a powerful tool for understanding and predicting tissue development, which can be crucial for designing therapeutic interventions and personalized treatments.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\nRisks include the computational challenges of scaling the models, the need for high-quality and extensive datasets, and the potential for model complexity to outweigh interpretability. There is also a risk of overfitting or poor generalization of the models to new data.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThis project will require significant computational resources and potentially some funding for data acquisition or collaboration with other labs. There may also be costs associated with attending advanced workshops or courses on machine learning and Active Inference.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\nThis project is expected to take approximately 6-9 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the models and the availability of data.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Mid-term Checkpoints:**\n  - Completion of a detailed literature review on scaling Active Inference models (2 weeks).\n  - Implementation of the initial multi-scale model framework (3-4 months).\n  - Initial validation of the model on a moderate-sized dataset (3-4 months).\n- **Final Checkpoints:**\n  - Completion of the full model implementation and validation on a large dataset (4-6 months).\n  - Presentation of the results in a research conference or journal publication.\n\n### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Integrating Active Inference with Network Biology for Rare Disease Modeling\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nDevelop an integrated framework combining Active Inference with network biology to model and predict the progression of rare diseases, focusing on the interplay between genetic, environmental, and cellular factors.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrent approaches to modeling rare diseases often rely on separate frameworks for genetic analysis, environmental factor assessment, and cellular modeling. These approaches lack the holistic and adaptive perspective that Active Inference can provide, leading to incomplete understanding and prediction of disease progression.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project integrates Active Inference with network biology to create a comprehensive model that captures the dynamic interactions between genetic, environmental, and cellular factors in rare diseases. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, such as Graph Neural Networks and VQ-VAE, and collaborating with the Bock and Menche labs, the project aims to develop highly accurate and predictive models of disease progression. The new approach involves applying Active Inference principles to model the adaptive processes in rare diseases, which could provide unprecedented insights into disease mechanisms.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nSuccess in this project will have a profound impact on the field of rare disease research, offering a novel framework for understanding and predicting disease progression. It will enable more targeted therapeutic interventions and personalized medicine approaches, significantly improving patient outcomes.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\nRisks include the complexity of integrating multiple frameworks, the need for extensive and high-quality datasets, and the potential for model overfitting or poor generalization. There is also a risk of ethical and regulatory challenges in applying such models to clinical settings.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThis project will require substantial funding for computational resources, data acquisition, and potential collaborations with other labs and biotech companies. There may also be significant costs associated with attending advanced workshops or courses and hiring additional personnel.\n\n#### 7.
