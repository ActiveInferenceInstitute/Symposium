What are you trying to do?\nCreate a simple Active Inference model to simulate and predict the behavior of single cells in a biological system.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrently, Active Inference models are often complex and require significant computational resources. The limits include the difficulty in scaling these models to higher-order biological systems and the lack of straightforward implementation guides for beginners. Existing models often rely on complex mathematical formulations that can be daunting for new researchers.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project will utilize PyTorch and Jax to implement a simplified Active Inference model specifically tailored for single cell biology. The approach will involve:\n- Using pre-existing tutorials and repositories (e.g., [Active Inference Tutorial Repository]) as a starting point.\n- Simplifying the model to focus on key variables and interactions relevant to single cell biology.\n- Implementing data-driven Markov blanket discovery to reduce the complexity of the model.\n\nThe success of this approach is anticipated due to the use of well-documented libraries (PyTorch and Jax) and the focus on a specific, manageable scope (single cell biology).\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nSuccess in this project will provide a clear, step-by-step guide for implementing Active Inference models in single cell biology, making it more accessible to researchers new to the field. This will facilitate the adoption of Active Inference in various biological research contexts.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\nThe primary risks include the potential complexity of even simplified Active Inference models and the need for accurate data to validate the model. Additionally, there is a risk that the simplified model may not capture all the nuances of the biological system.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThis project will not require significant financial resources, as it will rely on open-source libraries (PyTorch and Jax) and publicly available data.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\nThe project is expected to take approximately 1-2 weeks to complete, considering the focus on a simplified model and the use of existing resources.\n\n#### 8.
