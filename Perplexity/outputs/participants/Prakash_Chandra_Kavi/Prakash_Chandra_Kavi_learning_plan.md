### Learning Plan for Prakash Chandra Kavi: Active Inference and Free Energy Principle

#### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Book:** Begin reading "Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior" by Karl Friston. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to active inference and its applications[3].
- **Academic Papers:**
  - "Active Inference: A Process Theory" by Friston et al.[5]
  - "Thoughtseeds: Evolutionary Priors, Nested Markov Blankets, and the Emergence of Embodied Cognition" by Kavi et al.[4]
- **Video Resources:**
  - Karl Friston's lectures on YouTube, particularly those from the Active Inference Institute.
  - Machine Learning Street Talk's discussions on active inference.

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the core principles of active inference and the free energy principle.
- Familiarize yourself with the latest research and frameworks, such as the Thoughtseeds framework.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Dedicate 2 hours daily to reading and taking notes on the book and selected papers.
- Watch at least one video lecture per week and summarize the key points.
- Start a personal journal to record questions, insights, and areas for further exploration.

#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Free Energy Principle:** Deepen your understanding of how the free energy principle is applied in active inference.
- **Generative Models:** Learn how generative models are used in active inference to predict and explain sensory inputs.
- **Multi-Agent Systems:** Study the basics of multi-agent systems and how they can be integrated with active inference.

**Practical Exercises or Projects:**
- **Simulation Projects:** Use software tools like RxEnvironments.jl (mentioned in the IWAI workshop) to simulate simple active inference agents in reactive environments[1].
- **Coding Exercises:** Implement basic active inference models using Python or MATLAB, focusing on generative models and free energy minimization.

**Recommended Study Materials:**
- **Books:**
  - "Bayesian Statistics The Fun Way" to reinforce Bayesian statistics knowledge, crucial for active inference[3].
- **Academic Papers:**
  - "Active inference and learning" by Friston et al.[5]
  - "Scene Construction, Visual Foraging, and Active Inference" by Mirza et al.[5]
- **Courses:**
  - Online courses on Bayesian inference and probabilistic modeling (e.g., Coursera, edX).

**Community Engagement Opportunities:**
- **Join Online Forums:** Participate in forums like the Active Inference subreddit or relevant LinkedIn groups.
- **Attend Webinars:** Register for upcoming webinars or online workshops related to active inference, such as those organized by the Active Inference Institute.

#### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)

**Advanced Topics to Explore:**
- **Nested Markov Blankets:** Delve deeper into the concept of nested Markov blankets and their role in the Thoughtseeds framework[4].
- **Ergodic Principles:** Study how ergodic principles are applied to understand long-term behavior in active inference models[4].
- **Multi-Agent Active Inference:** Explore advanced topics in multi-agent active inference, including game-theoretic foundations and collective search models[1].

**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**
- **Research Collaborations:** Reach out to researchers from the 5th International Workshop on Active Inference, particularly those working on multi-agent systems and game-theoretic foundations of active inference[1].
- **Interdisciplinary Projects:** Collaborate with researchers from different disciplines (e.g., psychology, philosophy) to integrate active inference with other theoretical frameworks.

**Application Projects in Their Domain:**
- **Yoga Nidra Modeling:** Apply active inference to model cognitive states during Yoga Nidra, using EEG data and sleep wearables.
- **Lucid Dreaming Analysis:** Use active inference to analyze and predict lucid dreaming states, integrating insights from the Thoughtseeds framework.

**Skill-Building Activities:**
- **Programming Skills:** Enhance programming skills in languages like Python or MATLAB, focusing on libraries relevant to active inference (e.g., RxEnvironments.jl).
- **High-Performance Computing:** Learn to use high-performance computing facilities to make higher-order active inference models computationally tractable.

#### SPECIFIC RESOURCES
