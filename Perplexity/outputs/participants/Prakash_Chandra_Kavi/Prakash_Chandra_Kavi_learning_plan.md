- **Workshop Materials:** Review the program and presentations from the 5th International Workshop on Active Inference to get an overview of current trends and novel results in the field[2].

#### Initial Learning Objectives:
- Understand the fundamental principles of active inference and the free energy principle.
- Familiarize yourself with the "Thoughtseeds" framework and its application in cognitive modeling.
- Identify key challenges in computational tractability and multi-agent systems.

#### Concrete Actions to Take:
- **Reading and Note-taking:** Dedicate 2-3 hours each day to reading and taking detailed notes on the book and selected papers.
- **Workshop Review:** Spend 1-2 days reviewing the workshop program, presentations, and award-winning papers to understand current research directions.
- **Community Engagement:** Join online forums like the Active Inference community on GitHub or relevant research groups on social media platforms to start engaging with the community.

### Short-Term Goals (1-3 months)
