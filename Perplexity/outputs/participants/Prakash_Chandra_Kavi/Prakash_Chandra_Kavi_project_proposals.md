### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Simulating Active Inference Agents in Reactive Environments

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create a simulation to model how active inference agents interact with and learn from reactive environments, focusing on simple scenarios to understand the basics of active inference.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, simulations of active inference agents are often complex and require significant computational resources. The limits include the difficulty in making higher-order models computationally tractable and the lack of straightforward tools for beginners.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will utilize the RxEnvironments.jl software tool, which is specifically designed for simulating reactive environments in the context of active inference. By starting with simple scenarios, we can incrementally build complexity, ensuring that the models remain computationally tractable. This approach will also involve coding exercises in Python or MATLAB to implement basic active inference models, reinforcing the understanding of generative models and free energy minimization.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will provide a clear, step-by-step guide for researchers and students to simulate active inference agents, making the field more accessible. It will also help in validating the theoretical concepts of active inference through practical implementation, which can be shared within the active inference community.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the potential for computational complexity to escalate quickly, requiring more resources than anticipated, and the possibility that the simulations may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project should not incur significant costs, as it will primarily rely on open-source software tools like RxEnvironments.jl and existing computational resources.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take approximately 2-3 months, with the following milestones:
- **Month 1:** Set up the simulation environment and implement basic active inference models.
- **Month 2:** Run simulations and analyze results.
- **Month 3:** Document and share the findings.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point:** After the first month, review the implementation of the basic models and the initial simulation runs to ensure they are functioning as expected.
- **Final Check Point:** After three months, evaluate the completeness and accuracy of the simulations, and prepare a report or presentation to share with the community.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Applying Active Inference to Model Yoga Nidra States

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop an active inference model to understand and predict cognitive states during Yoga Nidra, using EEG data and sleep wearables.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, modeling cognitive states during meditative practices like Yoga Nidra is largely descriptive and lacks a robust theoretical framework. The limits include the lack of a unified model that integrates both physiological and subjective experience data.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will integrate the Thoughtseeds framework with active inference to model the dynamic interaction of self-organizing units of embodied knowledge during Yoga Nidra. By leveraging EEG data and sleep wearables, the model will capture both the physiological and subjective aspects of the experience. The use of nested Markov blankets and reciprocal message passing will help in understanding the hierarchical structure of cognitive states.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will provide a novel, biologically-grounded model for understanding the organizing principles of embodied cognition during meditative states. This can lead to better design of meditative practices, improved mental health interventions, and a deeper understanding of consciousness.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of integrating EEG data with the active inference framework, potential issues with data quality, and the challenge of validating the model against subjective experiences.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project may require some additional funding for data collection tools (e.g., EEG equipment, sleep wearables) and possibly high-performance computing resources. However, the costs should be manageable within a research budget.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take approximately 6-9 months, with the following milestones:
- **Months 1-3:** Literature review, data collection, and initial model development.
- **Months 4-6:** Model refinement, simulation, and data analysis.
- **Months 7-9:** Validation, writing, and preparation for publication.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point:** After the first 3 months, review the data collection process and the initial model implementation to ensure alignment with the project objectives.
- **Final Check Point:** After 9 months, evaluate the completeness of the model, the accuracy of predictions, and prepare the final report or publication.

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing a Multi-Agent Active Inference Framework for Embodied Cognition

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a multi-agent active inference framework that integrates evolutionary principles, neuronal packets, and the free energy principle to model embodied cognition in complex environments.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, active inference models are mostly applied to single-agent scenarios, and multi-agent systems are not well-integrated into the framework. The limits include the lack of a unified theoretical model that can handle the complexity of multi-agent interactions and embodied cognition.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will extend the Thoughtseeds framework to include multi-agent interactions, leveraging nested Markov blankets and reciprocal message passing. By integrating insights from evolutionary theory, neuronal packets, and the free energy principle, the framework will model how multiple agents interact and adapt in complex environments. The use of high-performance computing facilities will help in making the higher-order models computationally tractable.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will provide a groundbreaking, unified model for understanding embodied cognition in multi-agent scenarios, which can revolutionize fields such as artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and neuroscience. This framework can be applied to various domains, including robotics, social cognition, and collective decision-making.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the high computational complexity, potential difficulties in validating the model against real-world data, and the challenge of integrating multiple theoretical frameworks.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will likely require significant funding for high-performance computing resources, data collection tools, and possibly collaborations with other research groups. The estimated cost could be substantial, depending on the scope and resources needed.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take approximately 1-2 years, with the following milestones:
- **Months 1-6:** Literature review, framework development, and initial model implementation.
- **Months 7-12:** Model refinement, simulation, and data analysis.
- **Months 13-24:** Validation, writing, and preparation for publication.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point:** After the first 6 months, review the framework development and initial model implementation to ensure alignment with the project objectives.
- **Final Check Point:** After 2 years, evaluate the completeness of the model, the accuracy of predictions, and prepare the final report or publication.
