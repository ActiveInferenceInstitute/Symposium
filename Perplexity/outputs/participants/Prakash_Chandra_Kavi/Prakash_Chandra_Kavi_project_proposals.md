### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Implementing Simple Active Inference Models

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Implement and simulate simple active inference models to understand the practical application of the theory in cognitive modeling.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, active inference models are often implemented using complex mathematical frameworks, which can be daunting for newcomers. The limits include the computational complexity and the need for advanced programming skills. Most tutorials and implementations are scattered and not easily accessible for a comprehensive learning experience.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will involve creating a step-by-step guide and code repository for implementing simple active inference models using MATLAB or Python. This approach will simplify the learning process by providing a structured and accessible pathway for beginners. The use of widely available programming languages and tools will make it easier for researchers to replicate and build upon the models.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will benefit researchers and students new to active inference by providing a clear, hands-on introduction to the theory. It will facilitate faster learning and reduce the barrier to entry, making active inference more accessible and increasing its adoption in various fields.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Technical Challenges:** Ensuring the models are computationally efficient and accurately represent the theoretical concepts.
- **Documentation Quality:** Maintaining clarity and comprehensiveness in the guide and code comments.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will primarily require time and effort, with minimal costs associated with software tools (MATLAB or Python) that are often already available in academic settings.

#### 7. How long will it take?
Approximately 2-4 weeks to develop the initial models and documentation.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Weekly Reviews:** Conduct weekly reviews of the code and documentation to ensure clarity and accuracy.
- **Peer Review:** Share the initial version with peers for feedback before finalizing the repository.
- **Final Checkpoint:** Publish the guide and code repository and receive feedback from the active inference community.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with Multi-Agent Systems

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and simulate multi-agent active inference models to study collective behavior and decision-making processes.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current multi-agent systems often lack a unified framework that integrates active inference principles. The main limits include the complexity of modeling interactions between agents and the computational resources required to simulate large-scale systems.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will integrate the "Thoughtseeds" framework with multi-agent systems, leveraging nested Markov blankets to model interactions between agents. This approach will provide a novel hierarchical architecture for understanding collective behavior and decision-making. The use of advanced computational tools and high-performance computing resources will make the simulations more tractable.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will contribute significantly to the understanding of collective behavior in fields such as neuroscience, AI, and social sciences. It will provide a new framework for modeling complex systems and could lead to innovative applications in areas like robotics and social network analysis.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Computational Complexity:** Managing the computational demands of simulating large-scale multi-agent systems.
- **Theoretical Integration:** Ensuring the seamless integration of active inference principles with multi-agent systems theory.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project may require access to high-performance computing resources and potentially collaboration with experts in multi-agent systems, which could involve some costs or institutional support.

#### 7. How long will it take?
Approximately 3-6 months to develop the initial models, simulate the systems, and analyze the results.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Monthly Reviews:** Conduct monthly reviews of the model development and simulation progress.
- **Collaborator Feedback:** Get feedback from collaborators and peers on the theoretical integration and simulation results.
- **Final Checkpoint:** Publish a paper or present at a conference to share the findings and receive broader feedback.

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Active Inference in Clinical Applications for Neurological Disorders

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and validate active inference models for understanding and treating neurological disorders such as schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current clinical approaches often rely on empirical treatments without a comprehensive theoretical framework. The limits include the lack of personalized treatment plans and the inability to predict treatment outcomes accurately.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will apply the "Thoughtseeds" framework and active inference principles to model the cognitive and behavioral aspects of neurological disorders. It will involve integrating data from EEG, sleep wearables, and other clinical measurements to develop personalized models. The use of active inference will allow for the prediction of treatment outcomes and the optimization of therapeutic strategies.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will significantly impact clinical practice by providing personalized and predictive models for treating neurological disorders. It will improve treatment outcomes, reduce the trial-and-error approach in treatment, and enhance the quality of life for patients.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Data Quality and Availability:** Ensuring access to high-quality and sufficient clinical data.
- **Model Validation:** Validating the models against real-world clinical outcomes.
- **Ethical Considerations:** Addressing ethical issues related to using patient data and ensuring compliance with clinical regulations.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require significant funding for data collection, computational resources, and potential collaborations with clinical institutions.

#### 7. How long will it take?
Approximately 1-2 years to develop the models, collect and analyze the data, and validate the findings clinically.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Quarterly Progress Reviews:** Conduct quarterly reviews of model development, data collection, and preliminary analysis.
- **Clinical Collaborator Feedback:** Get feedback from clinical collaborators on the model's clinical relevance and potential impact.
- **Final Checkpoint:** Publish the findings in a high-impact journal and present at a major conference to disseminate the results widely.
- **Clinical Trial:** Conduct a clinical trial to validate the models and treatments, ensuring regulatory compliance and ethical standards.
