### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Implementing a Basic Active Inference Model for Sensory Prediction

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create a simple Active Inference model to predict sensory inputs in a controlled environment, such as predicting the position of a moving object.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, Active Inference models are often implemented in complex scenarios, such as in neuroscience or robotics, which can be daunting for beginners. The limits of current practice include the complexity of the mathematical underpinnings and the need for extensive computational resources.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project simplifies the implementation by focusing on a basic sensory prediction task. It will use existing tools like the SPM software and Python libraries (e.g., `pySPM`) to make the process more accessible. The approach will be successful because it starts with a manageable task, allowing for a clear understanding of the core concepts of Active Inference.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will provide a foundational understanding of Active Inference, enabling the participant to apply it in more complex scenarios later. It will also serve as a proof-of-concept for more advanced projects and help in building confidence in implementing Active Inference models.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risk is the potential difficulty in understanding the mathematical concepts or troubleshooting the implementation. However, this can be mitigated by using well-documented resources and seeking help from online forums or mentors.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project should be cost-effective, as it relies on freely available software tools and libraries. There may be a need for computational resources, but these can often be accessed through university or cloud services at minimal cost.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take about 1-2 weeks, depending on the participant's familiarity with the tools and concepts.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: After one week, the participant should have a basic understanding of the Active Inference framework and have started implementing the model.
- **Final Check Point**: At the end of two weeks, the participant should have a fully functional model predicting sensory inputs and be able to analyze the results.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Applying Active Inference in Multi-Agent Systems

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop an Active Inference model for multi-agent systems to enhance decision-making and coordination among agents in a dynamic environment.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, multi-agent systems often rely on traditional control theories or machine learning algorithms that may not fully account for the agents' internal states and predictive capabilities. The limits include the complexity of integrating multiple agents' behaviors and the need for advanced mathematical and computational tools.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project applies Active Inference to multi-agent systems, leveraging its ability to model agents' internal states and predictive processes. The approach will integrate insights from neuroscience and control theory, using tools like SPM and Python libraries. It will be successful because it addresses the current limitations by providing a more holistic and predictive framework for agent behavior.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will significantly impact fields like robotics, autonomous systems, and social learning. It will enable more efficient and coordinated decision-making among multiple agents, which can be crucial in applications such as swarm robotics or smart traffic management.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of the mathematical models, the potential for instability in multi-agent interactions, and the need for significant computational resources. These risks can be mitigated by iterative testing, using simulation environments, and collaborating with experts in the field.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project may require more substantial computational resources and potentially some software licenses. However, many resources can still be accessed through academic or cloud services at a reasonable cost.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take about 3-6 months, depending on the complexity of the multi-agent system and the participant's experience.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: After three months, the participant should have a working model for a simple multi-agent system and be able to analyze basic interactions.
- **Final Check Point**: At the end of six months, the participant should have a fully functional multi-agent system with Active Inference, demonstrating improved coordination and decision-making.

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing an Active Inference Framework for Human-AI Alignment

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create an Active Inference framework to enhance human-AI alignment, focusing on bidirectional alignment and mutual understanding between humans and AI systems.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current human-AI alignment efforts often lack a unified framework that accounts for both human and AI perspectives. The limits include the absence of a systematic approach to align human values with AI goals and the difficulty in integrating human feedback into AI decision-making processes[1].

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project leverages Active Inference to develop a bidirectional alignment framework, integrating insights from neuroscience, machine learning, and human-centered AI. The approach will be successful because it provides a systematic and iterative process for aligning human values and AI goals, using predictive coding and free energy principles to enhance mutual understanding.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will significantly impact the field of human-AI interaction, enabling more trustworthy and aligned AI systems. It will benefit various domains, including healthcare, finance, and social services, by ensuring AI systems are more transparent and responsive to human needs.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of integrating diverse disciplines, the potential for misalignment between human and AI perspectives, and the need for extensive validation and testing. These risks can be mitigated by collaborative research, iterative testing, and engaging with a broad range of stakeholders.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will likely require significant resources, including computational power, software licenses, and potentially funding for interdisciplinary research collaborations.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take about 1-2 years, depending on the scope and the participant's ability to collaborate with experts from various fields.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: After six months, the participant should have a preliminary framework for human-AI alignment using Active Inference and initial results from small-scale testing.
- **Final Check Point**: At the end of two years, the participant should have a fully developed and validated framework for bidirectional human-AI alignment, with demonstrated improvements in human-AI interaction and alignment.
