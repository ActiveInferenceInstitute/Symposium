### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Active Inference Simulation and Modeling

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create a simple simulation of an Active Inference model to understand its basic principles and apply it to a straightforward task, such as a robotic arm reaching for an object.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, Active Inference simulations are often complex and require significant expertise in both the theoretical aspects and the programming skills. The limits include the steep learning curve, the need for advanced mathematical understanding, and the lack of accessible tutorials for beginners.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will utilize the `spm` software package developed by Karl Friston's group, which provides a more accessible and user-friendly environment for simulating Active Inference models. The approach will also include step-by-step tutorials and guides to help beginners understand and replicate the simulations.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will make Active Inference more accessible to new learners, providing a clear and practical introduction to the field. This can help in increasing the adoption and understanding of Active Inference among students and researchers.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risk is the complexity of the underlying mathematics and the potential for misinterpretation or incorrect implementation of the models. However, using well-documented software and tutorials can mitigate this risk.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will not incur significant costs, as it relies on freely available software and academic resources.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take about 1-2 months, depending on the depth of the simulations and the learner's pace.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Weekly Checkpoints**: Complete reading and understanding of specific papers or chapters related to Active Inference.
- **Monthly Milestones**: Successfully simulate a simple Active Inference model and analyze its performance.
- **Final Checkpoint**: Present the simulation results and discuss the implications and potential applications.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Applying Active Inference to Real-World Robotics

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Apply Active Inference principles to a real-world robotics task, such as object recognition and manipulation, using a robotic arm.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, robotics tasks often rely on traditional machine learning approaches that may not fully incorporate the predictive and adaptive aspects of Active Inference. The limits include the lack of integration between cognitive models and robotic control systems.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will integrate Active Inference models with robotic control systems, leveraging the predictive coding and Bayesian inference aspects to improve the robot's adaptability and performance. The approach will involve using deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch to implement the Active Inference models.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of using Active Inference in robotics, potentially leading to more robust and adaptive robotic systems. This can have significant impacts in fields such as manufacturing, healthcare, and autonomous vehicles.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The risks include the complexity of integrating cognitive models with physical systems, the potential for instability in the control loop, and the need for extensive testing to ensure safety and reliability.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project may require some investment in robotic hardware and software tools, but leveraging open-source frameworks and existing resources can minimize costs.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take about 3-6 months, depending on the complexity of the task and the availability of resources.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Quarterly Checkpoints**: Complete the integration of Active Inference models with the robotic control system.
- **Mid-term Milestones**: Successfully demonstrate the robot's ability to perform the task using Active Inference.
- **Final Checkpoint**: Present the complete system and discuss the performance, challenges, and future improvements.

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing a Deep Active Inference Framework for Complex Decision-Making

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a comprehensive deep Active Inference framework that can handle complex decision-making tasks, such as those encountered in autonomous driving or financial trading.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, deep learning models are widely used for complex tasks, but they often lack the predictive and adaptive capabilities inherent in Active Inference. The limits include the difficulty in scaling Active Inference models to complex tasks and the lack of robustness against adversarial examples.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will leverage recent advances in deep learning to develop a scalable and robust deep Active Inference framework. The approach will involve integrating Bayesian neural networks with predictive coding, using techniques such as variational inference and adversarial training to enhance robustness.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will provide a powerful tool for complex decision-making tasks, potentially revolutionizing fields such as autonomous vehicles, financial markets, and healthcare. This can lead to more efficient, adaptive, and robust decision-making systems.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The risks include the high complexity of the project, the potential for instability in the models, and the need for significant computational resources and data. Additionally, there are ethical and governance issues related to the deployment of such advanced AI systems[3].

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project will likely require significant investment in computational resources, data, and possibly collaborative efforts with other researchers or institutions.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take about 1-2 years, depending on the scope and the availability of resources.
