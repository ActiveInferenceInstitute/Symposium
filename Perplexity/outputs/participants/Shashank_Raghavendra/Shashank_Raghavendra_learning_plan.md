  - Access the paper through academic databases like Google Scholar or the publisher's website.
- **Tutorials and Online Courses**:
  - Look into online courses or tutorials that introduce Active Inference, such as those offered on platforms like Coursera, edX, or YouTube channels dedicated to machine learning and cognitive science.
  - For example, the "Active Inference" course by Karl Friston on YouTube can provide a comprehensive introduction.

### Initial Learning Objectives
- Understand the basic principles of Active Inference.
- Familiarize yourself with key terminology and concepts.
- Recognize the applications and relevance of Active Inference in machine learning and cognitive science.

### Concrete Actions to Take
- **Read Foundational Papers**: Dedicate time to reading and understanding the core papers on Active Inference.
