### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Applying Active Inference to Simple Perception Tasks

#### What are you trying to do?
The objective of this project is to apply Active Inference to simple perception tasks, such as visual or auditory perception, to understand how this framework can be used in clinical settings to improve patient outcomes. Specifically, the goal is to simulate Active Inference models using the SPM toolbox and analyze their performance in basic perception tasks.

#### How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, perception tasks in clinical settings are often assessed using traditional psychometric tests. However, these methods may not capture the underlying neural mechanisms and can be limited in their ability to provide personalized insights. Active Inference offers a more mechanistic approach but requires technical expertise and computational resources.

#### What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project introduces the use of Active Inference models to simulate and analyze perception tasks. By leveraging the SPM toolbox, we can create and test these models in a controlled environment. This approach is new because it integrates Bayesian inference and the free energy principle to provide a more nuanced understanding of perceptual processes. It is expected to be successful because it allows for the simulation of various scenarios and the evaluation of model performance, which can inform clinical practice.

#### Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will be valuable to clinicians, researchers, and patients. By providing a more detailed understanding of perceptual processes, it can help in the development of more targeted therapies. For Dr. Karakashian, it will enhance his ability to integrate Active Inference into his clinical practice, particularly in the assessment and treatment of mental health conditions.

#### What are the risks?
The main risks include the technical challenges of simulating and analyzing Active Inference models, the need for specialized programming skills, and the potential for model misinterpretation. However, these risks can be mitigated by seeking mentorship and collaborating with experienced researchers.

#### How much will it cost?
The project will primarily require access to computational resources and the SPM toolbox, which is freely available. There may be some costs associated with attending workshops or online courses for additional training.

#### How long will it take?
This project is expected to take about 2-3 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the models and the depth of analysis.

#### What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point (1 month):** Completion of the installation and basic understanding of the SPM toolbox.
  - **Final Check Point (3 months):** Successful simulation and analysis of Active Inference models for simple perception tasks.
  - **Additional Check Point:** Presentation of findings in a local research seminar or online forum to gather feedback.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with Machine Learning for Personalized Psychotherapy

#### What are you trying to do?
The goal of this project is to integrate Active Inference with machine learning techniques to develop personalized psychotherapy plans. This involves using Active Inference models to understand patient behavior and incorporating machine learning algorithms to tailor treatment strategies based on individual patient data.

#### How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, psychotherapy plans are often standardized and may not fully account for individual patient differences. Active Inference provides a mechanistic framework, but it needs to be integrated with data-driven approaches like machine learning to be more effective. The current practice lacks this integration, leading to less personalized treatment plans.

#### What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project combines Active Inference with machine learning to create personalized treatment plans. By using Bayesian inference and the free energy principle from Active Inference, and machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data, this approach can provide more tailored and effective treatment strategies. This integration is new and expected to be successful because it leverages the strengths of both frameworks to improve patient outcomes.

#### Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will benefit clinicians, researchers, and patients by providing more personalized and effective treatment plans. For Dr. Karakashian, it will enhance his clinical practice by offering a more sophisticated approach to treating mental health conditions.

#### What are the risks?
The risks include the complexity of integrating two different methodologies, the need for significant computational resources, and the challenge of interpreting the combined models. Collaborating with experts in both Active Inference and machine learning can help mitigate these risks.

#### How much will it cost?
The costs will include computational resources, potential costs for attending workshops or conferences, and possibly hiring a programmer or data analyst with expertise in machine learning.

#### How long will it take?
This project is expected to take about 6-9 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the integration and the amount of data available for analysis.

#### What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point (3 months):** Successful integration of Active Inference models with basic machine learning algorithms.
  - **Mid-term Check Point (6 months):** Completion of a pilot study using the integrated approach on a small patient cohort.
  - **Final Check Point (9 months):** Presentation of findings in a peer-reviewed journal or at a conference, and implementation of the new treatment plans in clinical practice.

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing an Active Inference-Based Clinical Decision Support System for Mental Health

#### What are you trying to do?
The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive clinical decision support system (CDSS) based on Active Inference for mental health conditions. This system will integrate various data sources, including patient symptoms, behavioral data, and neuroimaging results, to provide personalized treatment recommendations.

#### How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, clinical decision-making in mental health often relies on clinical judgment and standardized protocols, which may not fully account for individual patient variability. Active Inference offers a mechanistic framework but is not yet widely integrated into clinical decision support systems.

#### What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project involves developing a CDSS that uses Active Inference to integrate multiple data sources and provide personalized treatment recommendations. This approach is new because it leverages the Bayesian inference and free energy principle to create a dynamic and adaptive system. It is expected to be successful because it combines the strengths of Active Inference with the practical needs of clinical decision-making.

#### Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will significantly benefit clinicians, researchers, and patients by providing a robust and personalized clinical decision support system. For Dr. Karakashian, it will revolutionize his clinical practice by offering a sophisticated tool for treating mental health conditions.

#### What are the risks?
The risks include the complexity of integrating multiple data sources, the need for significant computational resources and programming expertise, and the challenge of validating the system in real-world clinical settings. Collaborating with a multidisciplinary team of clinicians, researchers, and technologists can help mitigate these risks.

#### How much will it cost?
The costs will include significant computational resources, hiring a team of programmers and data analysts, and potential costs for attending workshops or conferences. There may also be costs associated with data collection and validation.

#### How long will it take?
This project is expected to take about 2-3 years to complete, depending on the complexity of the system and the extent of validation required.

#### What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point (6 months):** Completion of the initial design and prototype of the CDSS.
  - **Mid-term Check Point (1 year):** Successful integration of the first data sources (e.g., patient symptoms and behavioral data) into the system.
  - **Mid-term Check Point (18 months):** Integration of neuroimaging data and initial testing of the system in a controlled environment.
  - **Final Check Point (2-3 years):** Full validation of the system in real-world clinical settings and implementation in clinical practice, followed by a publication in a peer-reviewed journal or presentation at a major conference.
