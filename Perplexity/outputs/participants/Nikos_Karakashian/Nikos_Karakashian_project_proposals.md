### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Active Inference in Psychiatric Case Studies

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Analyze and apply Active Inference principles to real psychiatric case studies to understand how this framework can improve diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, psychiatric diagnoses and treatments often rely on traditional symptom-based approaches. While these methods are effective, they lack a unified theoretical framework that integrates cognitive, emotional, and behavioral aspects. The limits include the lack of a systematic approach to understanding patient behavior and cognition, leading to variability in treatment outcomes.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project introduces the application of Active Inference to psychiatric case studies. By using the free energy principle and Bayesian inference, we can model patients' cognitive processes and behaviors in a more integrated and systematic way. This approach is new because it provides a quantitative framework to understand patient data, which can lead to more personalized and effective treatment plans.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will benefit psychiatric patients by providing more accurate diagnoses and tailored therapeutic strategies. Clinicians, including those in family medicine and psychiatry, will have a new tool to enhance their practice. The broader psychiatric community will benefit from a more unified theoretical approach to understanding mental health.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of applying a new theoretical framework, potential resistance from clinicians unfamiliar with Active Inference, and the need for significant data collection and analysis.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The costs will be minimal, primarily involving time and resources for data collection, analysis, and writing. Access to existing case studies and collaboration with other researchers can reduce costs further.

Develop comprehensive educational materials, including tutorials, workshops, and case studies, to teach Active Inference principles to psychiatric and family medicine residents.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, educational materials on Active Inference are limited, and there is a lack of resources specifically tailored for psychiatric and family medicine professionals. This results in a gap in knowledge and skills among clinicians.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project involves creating educational materials that are specifically designed for psychiatric and family medicine residents. By incorporating real-world case studies and practical exercises, these materials will make Active Inference more accessible and applicable to clinical practice. The new approach includes interdisciplinary collaboration and feedback from clinicians to ensure the materials are relevant and effective.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will improve the education and training of psychiatric and family medicine residents, enabling them to integrate Active Inference into their clinical practice. This will lead to better patient outcomes and more innovative therapeutic strategies.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the challenge of creating engaging and effective educational materials, ensuring the materials are clinically relevant, and the potential resistance to adopting new theoretical frameworks.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The costs will include time, resources for developing materials, and potential travel for workshops. Estimated costs could be around $10,000 to $20,000, depending on the scope and resources needed.
