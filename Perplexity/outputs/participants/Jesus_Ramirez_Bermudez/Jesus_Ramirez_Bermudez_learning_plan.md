### Personalized Learning Plan for Jesus Ramirez-Bermudez on Active Inference

#### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Active Inference Framework Basics**: Review the foundational papers by Karl Friston on the free energy principle and predictive processing. A good starting point is Friston's 2010 paper "The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory?"[5].
- **Recent Conference Talks**: Watch the recordings of the recent conference "Pathologies of self-awareness" where Active Inference was applied to various neuropsychiatric conditions. Specifically, focus on Anna Ciaunica's talk "I Overthink Therefore I’m Not: a Active Inference Account of Depersonalisation" and Phillip Gerrans' talk "Suffering and the Self. Active inference and self-modelling"[1][2].

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Refresh understanding of the core principles of Active Inference.
- Gain insights into how Active Inference is applied to specific neuropsychiatric conditions like Depersonalization Disorder.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Register for the conference "Pathologies of self-awareness" to access the talk recordings if not already available publicly.
- Read Friston's 2010 paper and take notes on key concepts.
- Summarize the main points from the selected conference talks.

#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Precision Control and Sensory Attenuation**: Delve deeper into how aberrant precision control and sub-optimal sensory attenuation affect self-modelling in neuropsychiatric disorders.
- **Mathematical and Computational Aspects**: Enhance understanding of the mathematical underpinnings of Active Inference, including Bayesian inference and predictive processing.

**Practical Exercises or Projects:**
- **Case Study Analysis**: Select a few case studies on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Depersonalization Disorder, Cotard syndrome) and analyze them using the Active Inference framework.
- **Simulation Exercises**: Use software tools like MATLAB or Python libraries (e.g., SPM) to simulate Active Inference models and understand their practical implementation.

**Recommended Study Materials:**
- **Books**: "The free energy principle: a unified brain theory?" by Karl Friston and "Active inference: the free energy principle in mind, brain, and behavior" by Thomas Parr and Giovanni Pezzulo[5].
- **Tutorials and Courses**: Online courses or tutorials on Bayesian inference and predictive processing, such as those found on Coursera or edX.
- **Academic Papers**: Regularly read recent papers published in journals like *Frontiers in Psychology* and *Neuron* that apply Active Inference to neuropsychiatric conditions[3][5].

**Community Engagement Opportunities:**
- **Join Online Forums**: Participate in online forums and discussion groups focused on Active Inference, such as the Active Inference subreddit or specialized LinkedIn groups.
- **Attend Workshops and Webinars**: Look for upcoming workshops or webinars on Active Inference and neuropsychiatry, such as those organized by the Ecole Normale Supérieure or similar institutions[2].

#### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)

**Advanced Topics to Explore:**
- **Interdisciplinary Applications**: Explore how Active Inference is applied in other fields like psychology, philosophy, and computational neuroscience.
- **Advanced Mathematical Techniques**: Dive deeper into advanced mathematical techniques used in Active Inference, such as variational inference and hierarchical models.

**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**
- **Interdisciplinary Research Projects**: Collaborate with researchers from other disciplines on projects that integrate Active Inference with other theoretical frameworks.
- **Clinical Applications**: Work with clinicians to develop and test Active Inference models in real-world clinical settings.

**Application Projects in Their Domain:**
- **Developing Diagnostic Tools**: Use Active Inference to develop diagnostic tools for neuropsychiatric disorders, integrating clinical data and observations.
- **Therapeutic Interventions**: Explore how Active Inference can inform the development of new therapeutic approaches for conditions like PTSD and Alzheimer's disease.

**Skill-Building Activities:**
- **Programming Skills**: Improve programming skills in languages like MATLAB or Python to better implement and analyze Active Inference models.
