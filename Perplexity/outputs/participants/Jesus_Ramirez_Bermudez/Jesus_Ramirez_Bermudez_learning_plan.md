### Personalized Learning Plan for Jesus Ramirez-Bermudez: Active Inference in Neuropsychiatry

#### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Active Inference Framework Basics**: Review the foundational paper by Karl Friston on the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference[3].
  - Resource: "The Free-Energy Principle: A Unified Brain Theory?" by Karl Friston[3].
- **Recent Applications in Neuropsychiatry**: Read the presentation abstracts and related papers from the "Pathologies of Self-Awareness" conference, particularly those by Anna Ciaunica, Phillip Gerrans, and Heidi Haanila[2][5].

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Refresh understanding of the core principles of Active Inference.
- Update knowledge on recent applications of Active Inference in neuropsychiatric disorders.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Dedicate 2 hours each day for the next week to reading and summarizing key papers.
- Prepare a brief report on how the concepts from these papers can be applied to current research projects.
- Reach out to Anna Ciaunica and Phillip Gerrans to discuss potential collaboration opportunities based on their work presented at the conference.

#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Predictive Processing and Precision Control**: Deepen understanding of how predictive processing and precision control mechanisms are implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders.
- **Sensory Attenuation and Self-Modelling**: Explore the role of sensory attenuation in self-modelling and its disruption in conditions like Depersonalisation Disorder.

**Practical Exercises or Projects:**
- **Case Study Analysis**: Apply Active Inference to analyze a series of clinical cases, such as those involving depersonalization or Cotard syndrome.
  - Resource: Use case studies presented by Jesus Ramirez-Bermudez himself, such as Anton syndrome, asomatognosia, and pain asymbolia[5].
- **Simulation Models**: Use software tools like MATLAB or Python to simulate predictive processing models and explore how different parameters affect self-modelling.

**Recommended Study Materials:**
- **Books**:
  - "The Free-Energy Principle: A Rough Guide to the Brain?" by Karl Friston.
  - "Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior" by Thomas Parr and Karl Friston.
- **Academic Papers**:
  - "Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior" by Thomas Parr and Karl Friston[3].
  - "Depersonalisation Disorder: An Active Inference Account" by Anna Ciaunica[2][5].

**Community Engagement Opportunities:**
- **Attend or Organize Workshops**: Participate in or organize interdisciplinary workshops that bring together neuroscientists, psychiatrists, and philosophers to discuss Active Inference.
  - Resource: Register for the "Pathologies of Self-Awareness" conference or similar events[2][5].
- **Join Online Forums**: Engage with online communities and forums focused on Active Inference and predictive processing, such as the Active Inference subreddit or specialized LinkedIn groups.

#### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)

**Advanced Topics to Explore:**
- **Mathematical Underpinnings of Active Inference**: Delve deeper into the mathematical and computational aspects of Active Inference.
  - Resource: Take online courses or attend seminars on Bayesian inference and computational neuroscience.
- **Clinical Translation and Therapeutic Applications**: Investigate how Active Inference models can be translated into clinical practice, including potential therapeutic approaches.

**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**
- **Collaborate with Theoretical Neuroscientists**: Work with researchers specializing in the theoretical aspects of Active Inference to gain deeper insights.
  - Resource: Collaborate with researchers like Karl Friston or Thomas Parr.
- **Interdisciplinary Research Projects**: Participate in or lead interdisciplinary research projects that combine clinical, neuroscientific, and philosophical perspectives.

**Application Projects in Their Domain:**
- **Develop Predictive Models for Neuropsychiatric Disorders**: Use Active Inference to develop predictive models for specific neuropsychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia or depersonalization disorder.
- **Validate Models with Empirical Data**: Collaborate with clinical teams to gather and analyze empirical data to validate the predictive models.

**Skill-Building Activities:**
- **Programming Skills**: Enhance programming skills in MATLAB, Python, or R to better simulate and analyze predictive processing models.
  - Resource: Online courses like those on Coursera or edX.
- **Writing and Communication**: Improve writing and communication skills to effectively publish research and present findings in both clinical and theoretical contexts.
  - Resource: Attend writing workshops or join a writing group.

#### SPECIFIC RESOURCES

- **Active Inference Institute Materials**:
  - The Free Energy Principle website and resources by Karl Friston.
- **Academic Papers and Tutorials**:
  - Papers by Karl Friston, Thomas Parr, and other key researchers in the field.
