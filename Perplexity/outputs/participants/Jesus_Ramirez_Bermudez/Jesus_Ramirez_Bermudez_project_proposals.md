### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Applying Active Inference to Depersonalization Disorder Case Studies

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Analyze and apply Active Inference to a series of clinical case studies of Depersonalization Disorder (DPD) to better understand the underlying mechanisms and develop a more nuanced clinical approach.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, DPD is often explained using modular or representational theories that focus on intact sensory processing but impaired affective/emotional processing. However, these theories have limitations in fully capturing the complex self-modelling disruptions seen in DPD. The current practice lacks a unified framework that integrates both sensory and emotional aspects.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
Using Active Inference, we will model DPD as a disorder of aberrant self-modelling, where patients exhibit altered precision control and sensory attenuation. This approach integrates both sensory and emotional processing within a single framework, providing a more comprehensive understanding. The success of this approach is based on the theoretical coherence of Active Inference in explaining other neuropsychiatric disorders.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Clinicians and researchers in neuropsychiatry will benefit from this work, as it could lead to more accurate diagnoses and tailored therapeutic interventions for DPD patients. Understanding DPD through Active Inference could also contribute to the broader validation of the theory in clinical practice.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risk is that the Active Inference framework may not fully capture the complexities of DPD, or that the case studies may not provide sufficient data to draw robust conclusions. However, given the participant's expertise and the existing literature, this risk is mitigated.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will primarily require time and access to existing case studies. There may be minimal costs associated with software tools for data analysis, but these are likely to be covered by current research budgets.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 2-3 months, given the focused scope and the availability of existing case studies.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point (1 month):** Complete a literature review and select the case studies to be analyzed.
- **Final Check Point (3 months):** Present a detailed analysis and report on the application of Active Inference to DPD case studies, including any preliminary conclusions and recommendations for further research.

**Potential Collaborators or Resources:**
- Collaborate with Anna Ciaunica and Phillip Gerrans, who have presented similar work on pathologies of self-awareness.
- Utilize resources from the "Pathologies of Self-Awareness" conference and relevant academic papers by Karl Friston and Thomas Parr.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Developing Predictive Models for Neuropsychiatric Disorders Using Active Inference

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop predictive models for specific neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, depersonalization disorder) using the Active Inference framework, and validate these models with empirical data.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, predictive models in neuropsychiatry are often fragmented and lack a unified theoretical basis. They may focus on specific symptoms or cognitive deficits without integrating the broader self-modelling and precision control aspects. This fragmentation limits the predictive power and clinical utility of these models.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
Using Active Inference, we will develop integrated predictive models that account for the interplay between sensory processing, precision control, and self-modelling. These models will be validated using empirical data from clinical studies, providing a more robust and clinically relevant framework. The success of this approach is grounded in the theoretical coherence of Active Inference and its demonstrated applicability in various neuropsychiatric contexts.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
The development of validated predictive models will significantly impact clinical practice by enabling better diagnosis, prognosis, and personalized treatment plans for neuropsychiatric disorders. Researchers and clinicians will benefit from these models, leading to improved patient outcomes.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The risks include the complexity of developing and validating predictive models, the need for high-quality empirical data, and the potential for the models to not capture the full complexity of the disorders. However, collaborating with clinical teams and leveraging existing data sets can mitigate these risks.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require resources for data collection, software tools for model development, and potentially some travel for collaboration meetings. The costs are estimated to be moderate, likely within the range of $10,000 to $20,000 over 6 months.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 6 months, including the development of the models, data collection, and validation phases.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point (3 months):** Complete the development of the predictive models and initiate data collection.
- **Final Check Point (6 months):** Present the validated models, including the results of empirical validation and any clinical implications.

**Potential Collaborators or Resources:**
- Collaborate with Karl Friston, Thomas Parr, and other researchers specializing in the theoretical aspects of Active Inference.
- Utilize software tools like MATLAB or Python libraries for simulating predictive processing models.
- Engage with clinical teams at the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery for data collection and validation.

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Clinical Translation of Active Inference Models for Therapeutic Interventions in Neuropsychiatry

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Translate Active Inference models into clinical practice by developing novel therapeutic approaches for neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depersonalization disorder, schizophrenia, and chronic pain, and conducting clinical trials to evaluate their efficacy.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, therapeutic approaches for neuropsychiatric disorders often rely on empirical treatments that lack a clear theoretical basis. This can result in variable efficacy and a lack of personalized treatment plans. The current practice is limited by the absence of a unified framework that integrates both the clinical and theoretical aspects of these disorders.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
Using Active Inference, we will develop therapeutic interventions based on predictive processing and self-modelling disruptions in neuropsychiatric disorders. These interventions will be tailored to the specific mechanisms underlying each disorder, providing a more targeted and potentially more effective treatment approach. The success of this approach is based on the robust theoretical foundation of Active Inference and its potential to integrate clinical and theoretical insights.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
The development of novel therapeutic approaches based on Active Inference could significantly improve treatment outcomes for patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. Clinicians, researchers, and patients will benefit from more effective and personalized treatments, leading to improved quality of life and better mental health outcomes.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The risks include the complexity of translating theoretical models into clinical practice, the need for extensive clinical trials, and the potential for the interventions to not be as effective as anticipated. However, careful planning, collaboration with clinical teams, and rigorous testing can mitigate these risks.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require substantial resources, including funding for clinical trials, software and hardware for data analysis, and personnel costs. The estimated cost is likely to be in the range of $100,000 to $200,000 over 2 years.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 2 years, including the development of therapeutic protocols, clinical trials, and the evaluation of treatment efficacy.
