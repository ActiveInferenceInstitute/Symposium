A good starting point is Friston's 2010 paper \"The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory?\"[5].\n- **Recent Conference Talks**: Watch the recordings of the recent conference \"Pathologies of self-awareness\" where Active Inference was applied to various neuropsychiatric conditions. Specifically, focus on Anna Ciaunica's talk \"I Overthink Therefore I\u2019m Not: a Active Inference Account of Depersonalisation\" and Phillip Gerrans' talk \"Suffering and the Self. Active inference and self-modelling\"[1][2].\n\n**Initial Learning Objectives:**\n- Refresh understanding of the core principles of Active Inference.\n- Gain insights into how Active Inference is applied to specific neuropsychiatric conditions like Depersonalization Disorder.\n\n**Concrete Actions to Take:**\n- Register for the conference \"Pathologies of self-awareness\" to access the talk recordings if not already available publicly.\n- Read Friston's 2010 paper and take notes on key concepts.\n- Summarize the main points from the selected conference talks.\n\n#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)\n\n**Key Concepts to Master:**\n- **Precision Control and Sensory Attenuation**: Delve deeper into how aberrant precision control and sub-optimal sensory attenuation affect self-modelling in neuropsychiatric disorders.\n- **Mathematical and Computational Aspects**: Enhance understanding of the mathematical underpinnings of Active Inference, including Bayesian inference and predictive processing.\n\n**Practical Exercises or Projects:**\n- **Case Study Analysis**: Select a few case studies on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Depersonalization Disorder, Cotard syndrome) and analyze them using the Active Inference framework.\n- **Simulation Exercises**: Use software tools like MATLAB or Python libraries (e.g., SPM) to simulate Active Inference models and understand their practical implementation.\n\n**Recommended Study Materials:**\n- **Books**: \"The free energy principle: a unified brain theory?\" by Karl Friston and \"Active inference: the free energy principle in mind, brain, and behavior\" by Thomas Parr and Giovanni Pezzulo[5].\n- **Tutorials and Courses**: Online courses or tutorials on Bayesian inference and predictive processing, such as those found on Coursera or edX.\n- **Academic Papers**: Regularly read recent papers published in journals like *Frontiers in Psychology* and *Neuron* that apply Active Inference to neuropsychiatric conditions[3][5].\n\n**Community Engagement Opportunities:**\n- **Join Online Forums**: Participate in online forums and discussion groups focused on Active Inference, such as the Active Inference subreddit or specialized LinkedIn groups.\n- **Attend Workshops and Webinars**: Look for upcoming workshops or webinars on Active Inference and neuropsychiatry, such as those organized by the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure or similar institutions[2].\n\n#### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)\n\n**Advanced Topics to Explore:**\n- **Interdisciplinary Applications**: Explore how Active Inference is applied in other fields like psychology, philosophy, and computational neuroscience.\n- **Advanced Mathematical Techniques**: Dive deeper into advanced mathematical techniques used in Active Inference, such as variational inference and hierarchical models.\n\n**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**\n- **Interdisciplinary Research Projects**: Collaborate with researchers from other disciplines on projects that integrate Active Inference with other theoretical frameworks.\n- **Clinical Applications**: Work with clinicians to develop and test Active Inference models in real-world clinical settings.\n\n**Application Projects in Their Domain:**\n- **Developing Diagnostic Tools**: Use Active Inference to develop diagnostic tools for neuropsychiatric disorders, integrating clinical data and observations.\n- **Therapeutic Interventions**: Explore how Active Inference can inform the development of new therapeutic approaches for conditions like PTSD and Alzheimer's disease.\n\n**Skill-Building Activities:**\n- **Programming Skills**: Improve programming skills in languages like MATLAB or Python to better implement and analyze Active Inference models.\n- **Data Analysis**: Enhance data analysis skills using tools like SPM or other neuroimaging software to integrate with Active Inference models.\n\n#### SPECIFIC RESOURCES\n\n**Active Inference Institute Materials:**\n- The official website of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging has extensive resources and tutorials on Active Inference.\n- Karl Friston's research group publications and resources.\n\n**Academic Papers and Tutorials:**\n- Papers by Friston, Parr, and Pezzulo on Active Inference and predictive processing.\n- Tutorials on Bayesian inference and predictive processing available on academic platforms.\n\n**Software Tools and Frameworks:**\n- **SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping) Software**: A widely used tool for neuroimaging analysis that can be integrated with Active Inference models.\n- **MATLAB and Python Libraries**: Use libraries like SPM or custom scripts to simulate and analyze Active Inference models.\n\n**Community Resources and Events:**\n- Conferences like the one on \"Pathologies of self-awareness\" organized by the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure.\n- Online forums and discussion groups dedicated to Active Inference.\n\n#### PROGRESS TRACKING\n\n**Milestones and Checkpoints:**\n- **Monthly Review**: Set a monthly review to assess progress on key concepts and practical exercises.\n- **Quarterly Project Evaluations**: Evaluate the progress on application projects and collaboration efforts every quarter.\n\n**Self-Assessment Methods:**\n- **Reflective Journaling**: Maintain a reflective journal to track understanding and challenges faced.\n- **Peer Review**: Engage with peers or mentors for regular feedback on the work and understanding.\n\n**Practical Application Opportunities:**\n- **Case Studies and Clinical Data Analysis**: Regularly apply Active Inference to real-world case studies and clinical data to reinforce learning.\n- **Workshops and Conferences**: Present findings or participate in workshops to receive feedback and stay updated with the latest developments.\n\n### Actionable Steps and Timeline\n\n#### Immediate Next Steps (1-2 weeks):\n1. **Register and Access Conference Talks**:\n   -
