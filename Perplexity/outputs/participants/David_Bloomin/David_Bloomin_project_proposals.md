### Proposal 1: Implementing a Simple Active Inference Agent Using Deep Learning

#### What are you trying to do?
Create a basic Active Inference agent that navigates a simple environment using deep learning techniques to approximate variational inference.

#### How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, Active Inference agents are often designed with hand-crafted generative models and priors, which can be cumbersome and limited in their ability to generalize to complex environments. The computational intractability of Bayesian inference is a significant limitation, and approximations using variational inference are necessary but often simplistic.

#### What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will use deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) to learn the generative model and priors automatically, rather than relying on manual engineering. By leveraging David Bloomin's experience in deep learning and Active Inference, this approach can potentially create more adaptable and efficient agents.

#### Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will provide a practical example of how Active Inference can be integrated with deep learning, making it easier for researchers to implement and test Active Inference agents in various environments. This can lead to more widespread adoption of Active Inference in AI research.

#### What are the risks?
The main risks include the difficulty in stabilizing the training process of deep learning models and ensuring that the learned generative models align with the principles of Active Inference.

#### How much will it cost?
This project will primarily require computational resources (e.g., GPU access) and time. No significant external funding is expected to be necessary.

#### How long will it take?
This project is expected to take around 1-2 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the environment and the depth of the generative model.

#### What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Initial Checkpoint (2 weeks):** Successful implementation of a basic deep learning model to approximate the generative model.
- **Mid-term Checkpoint (6 weeks):** The agent should be able to navigate a simple environment effectively.
- **Final Checkpoint (2 months):** The agent demonstrates adaptive learning and decision-making in the chosen environment.

### Proposal 2: Developing Multi-Agent Simulations for Collective Intelligence Using Active Inference

#### What are you trying to do?
Design and implement a multi-agent simulation environment where agents interact and learn from each other using Active Inference principles, focusing on collective intelligence and socially complex interactions.

#### How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, multi-agent simulations often lack the sophistication of real-world social interactions and do not fully incorporate the adaptive learning mechanisms of Active Inference. Existing models may not scale well to complex environments and may result in simplistic or unrealistic agent behaviors.

#### What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will integrate Active Inference with deep reinforcement learning to create agents that learn from each other in a socially complex environment. By leveraging David Bloomin's work on Metta AI Training and his experience with multi-agent systems, this approach can create more realistic and adaptive multi-agent simulations.

#### Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will contribute significantly to the field of collective intelligence and multi-agent systems, providing a framework for simulating and understanding complex social interactions. This can have implications for fields such as economics, social sciences, and AI safety.

#### What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of managing multiple agents with different goals and behaviors, ensuring the stability of the learning process, and avoiding the "kill or be killed" dynamic in competitive environments.

#### How much will it cost?
This project will require significant computational resources and potentially some funding for accessing advanced computational infrastructure or collaborating with other researchers.

#### How long will it take?
This project is expected to take around 3-6 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the simulation environment and the number of agents involved.

#### What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Initial Checkpoint (1 month):** Successful setup of the multi-agent simulation environment.
- **Mid-term Checkpoint (3 months):** Agents demonstrate basic learning and interaction behaviors.
- **Final Checkpoint (6 months):** The simulation shows emergent collective intelligence and adaptive behaviors among the agents.

### Proposal 3: Advanced Active Inference Framework for Real-World Applications in Economic and Social Systems

#### What are you trying to do?
Develop an advanced Active Inference framework that integrates hierarchical models, deep learning, and reinforcement learning to apply to real-world economic and social systems, such as social networks or economic forecasting.

#### How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, Active Inference is mostly applied in theoretical or simplified environments. Real-world applications, especially in economic and social systems, are limited due to the complexity of these systems and the lack of scalable and adaptable models.

#### What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will develop a hierarchical Active Inference framework that combines discrete and continuous variables, using deep learning to learn the generative models and priors. By collaborating with researchers from economics and social sciences, this approach can create models that are both theoretically grounded and practically applicable.

#### Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project can lead to the development of advanced AI systems that can predict and adapt to complex economic and social behaviors, potentially revolutionizing fields such as economic forecasting, social network analysis, and policy-making.

#### What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of integrating multiple disciplines, ensuring the scalability of the models, and addressing ethical concerns related to the application of AI in social and economic systems.

#### How much will it cost?
This project will likely require significant funding to support the collaboration with researchers from various fields, access to advanced computational resources, and potentially data collection and analysis.

#### How long will it take?
This project is expected to take around 1-2 years to complete, depending on the scope and the complexity of the real-world applications.

#### What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Initial Checkpoint (3 months):** Successful development of the hierarchical Active Inference model framework.
- **Mid-term Checkpoint (6 months):** Integration of deep learning and reinforcement learning components.
- **Mid-term Checkpoint (1 year):** Initial application and testing in a simplified real-world scenario.
- **Final Checkpoint (2 years):** Full-scale deployment and evaluation of the framework in real-world economic and social systems.
