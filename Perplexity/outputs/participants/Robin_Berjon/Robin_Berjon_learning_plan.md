### Personalized Learning Plan for Robin Berjon: Active Inference in Governance and Privacy

#### Immediate Next Steps (1-2 weeks)
**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Introduction to Active Inference:**
  - Start with introductory articles and videos on Active Inference, such as those found on the [Active Inference Institute](https://www.activeinference.org/) website.
  - Read the introductory chapter of "Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Action" by Karl Friston et al..

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the basic principles of Active Inference.
- Recognize how Active Inference can be applied in decision-making processes.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Spend 2-3 hours reading introductory materials on Active Inference.
- Watch a webinar or lecture series on Active Inference, such as those hosted by the University of Illinois (e.g., the [IQUIST Seminar series][1] might have relevant topics, though not directly on Active Inference, it can provide a broader context).
- Join online forums or discussion groups focused on Active Inference to ask initial questions and get a feel for the community.

#### Short-Term Goals (1-3 months)
**Key Concepts to Master:**
- Bayesian inference and its application in Active Inference.
- The free energy principle.
- Basic mathematical formulations of Active Inference.

**Practical Exercises or Projects:**
- Use software tools like MATLAB or Python libraries (e.g., [PyMC3](https://www.pymc3.org/)) to implement simple Active Inference models.
- Apply Active Inference to a hypothetical privacy decision-making scenario to understand its practical implications.

**Recommended Study Materials:**
- **Textbooks and Articles:**
  - "Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Action" by Karl Friston et al.
  - Articles on arXiv or PubMed related to Active Inference and decision-making.
- **Online Courses:**
  - Coursera, edX, or Udacity courses on Bayesian inference and machine learning.
  - Webinars from institutions like the University of Illinois or other academic bodies that may touch on related topics[1].

**Community Engagement Opportunities:**
- Participate in online forums such as Reddit's r/MachineLearning or r/ActiveInference.
- Attend webinars or seminars that align with his interests, such as the [COLLOQUIUM: Simon Du, "Pre-Training Data Selection for Representation Learning"][1], which could offer insights into related areas.

#### Medium-Term Development (3-6 months)
**Advanced Topics to Explore:**
- Advanced mathematical formulations of Active Inference.
- Integration of Active Inference with other machine learning techniques.
- Case studies of Active Inference in governance and privacy.

**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**
- Collaborate with researchers from the University of Illinois, such as those involved in the [IQUIST Seminar series][1], to explore how Active Inference can be applied in institutional decision-making.
- Connect with experts from the Metagov community, such as Alex Culliere or Ámbar Tenorio-Fornés, who have interests in decentralized governance and technology[2].

**Application Projects in Their Domain:**
- Develop a prototype using Active Inference to optimize privacy decision-making in a hypothetical data governance scenario.
- Analyze existing privacy mechanisms (e.g., Global Privacy Control) and propose improvements using Active Inference.

**Skill-Building Activities:**
- Attend advanced workshops or conferences on Active Inference and related fields.
- Participate in hackathons or coding challenges focused on machine learning and decision-making.

#### Specific Resources
**Active Inference Institute Materials:**
- [Active Inference Institute](https://www.activeinference.org/) resources, including tutorials, webinars, and research papers.
