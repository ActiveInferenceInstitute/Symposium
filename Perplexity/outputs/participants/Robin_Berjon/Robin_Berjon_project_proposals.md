### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference for Enhanced User Privacy Signals

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a simple Active Inference model to enhance the effectiveness of the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal in respecting user privacy preferences.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, the GPC signal is a binary control that informs websites of a user's preference to opt-out of data collection. However, its effectiveness is limited by the lack of clear guidance from regulators and the adtech ecosystem, and not all major browsers support it. The current implementation does not leverage advanced modeling to understand and predict user behavior[1].

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will integrate Active Inference to model user behavior and preferences more accurately. By using Bayesian models, the system can infer user intentions beyond a simple binary signal, allowing for more nuanced and context-dependent privacy settings. This approach leverages Robin Berjon's expertise in privacy and governance to ensure the model aligns with existing privacy regulations and user expectations.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will enhance user trust in digital infrastructure by providing more robust and personalized privacy controls. Publishers can still generate revenue through contextual advertising while respecting user privacy, reducing the risk of reputational harm and liability. This aligns with Berjon's goals of promoting user-centric and privacy-protective systems.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risks include the complexity of integrating Bayesian models with existing GPC mechanisms, potential resistance from publishers who rely on behavioral data, and the need for browser support. Additionally, there is a risk that the model may not accurately capture user intentions, leading to unintended consequences.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The costs will be relatively low, primarily involving time and resources for developing and testing the Active Inference model. This could be a solo project or involve minimal collaboration with other researchers.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project can be completed within 1-3 months, depending on the complexity of the model and the availability of data for testing.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint:** Develop a basic Active Inference model and integrate it with a mock GPC system within the first month.
- **Final Checkpoint:** Test the model with real-world data and evaluate its performance in respecting user privacy preferences within three months.
- **Collaborators/Resources:** Engage with privacy advocates and researchers from organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the Metagov community.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Active Inference for Multi-Agent Privacy Governance

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop an Active Inference framework to manage privacy in multi-agent systems, ensuring that each agent respects user privacy preferences while interacting within a complex network.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current approaches to privacy governance in multi-agent systems often rely on static rules and lack the ability to adapt to dynamic user preferences. This can lead to inconsistencies and violations of privacy, especially in systems where multiple agents interact and share data[5].

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will apply Active Inference to model the behavior of multiple agents and predict their interactions in a way that respects user privacy preferences. By using Bayesian inference, the system can adapt to changing user intentions and ensure that all agents comply with privacy regulations. This approach leverages Berjon's expertise in governance and privacy to create a more robust and adaptive privacy framework.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will significantly enhance privacy protection in complex digital ecosystems. It will provide a scalable and adaptive solution for managing privacy in multi-agent systems, ensuring that user data is handled securely and in compliance with regulations. This aligns with Berjon's goals of promoting democratic and user-centric governance of digital infrastructure.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risks include the complexity of modeling multi-agent interactions, the need for significant data to train the models, and potential challenges in ensuring all agents comply with the Active Inference framework. There is also a risk of over-reliance on the model, which could lead to unforeseen consequences if the model fails.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The costs will be moderate, involving resources for developing and testing the Active Inference framework, as well as potential collaboration with other researchers and organizations.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project can be completed within 6-12 months, depending on the complexity of the multi-agent system and the availability of data for training and testing.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint:** Develop a basic Active Inference model for a simple multi-agent system within the first six months.
- **Final Checkpoint:** Test the model with a complex multi-agent system and evaluate its performance in ensuring privacy compliance within 12 months.
- **Collaborators/Resources:** Collaborate with researchers from the Metagov community, privacy advocacy groups, and experts in multi-agent systems.

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Active Inference-Based Governance Framework for Digital Infrastructure

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a comprehensive governance framework for digital infrastructure using Active Inference, integrating it with existing governance models to create a more transparent, democratic, and user-centric system.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current governance models for digital infrastructure often lack transparency and democratic participation, leading to concentration of power among a few large companies. They do not effectively integrate user preferences and behaviors into decision-making processes[4].

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will use Active Inference to model user behavior and preferences, integrating these models into a broader governance framework. By leveraging Bayesian inference, the system can predict and adapt to changing user needs, ensuring that governance decisions are more transparent and responsive to user interests. This approach aligns with Berjon's advocacy for public interest governance and democratic control of digital infrastructure.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will revolutionize the governance of digital infrastructure, making it more democratic, transparent, and user-centric. It will enhance trust in digital systems, ensure better compliance with privacy regulations, and provide a model for other sectors to follow. This aligns with Berjon's long-term goals of promoting public interest governance.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risks include the complexity of integrating Active Inference with existing governance frameworks, potential resistance from powerful stakeholders, and the need for significant resources and data to develop and validate the models. There is also a risk of unintended consequences if the model does not accurately capture user intentions.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The costs will be substantial, involving significant resources for research, development, testing, and implementation. This will likely require funding and collaboration with multiple stakeholders.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project can take 1-3 years to complete, depending on the scope and complexity of the governance framework and the availability of resources.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint:** Develop a basic governance framework integrating Active Inference within the first year.
- **Final Checkpoint:** Implement and test the framework in a real-world setting, evaluating its performance and impact within 2-3 years.
- **Collaborators/Resources:** Collaborate with researchers from the Metagov community, privacy advocacy groups, technology governance experts, and organizations involved in digital infrastructure governance. Utilize resources such as the University of Illinois Speaker Series, online forums, and specialized training platforms.
