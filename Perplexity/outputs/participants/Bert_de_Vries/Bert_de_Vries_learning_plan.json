This will help align his existing knowledge with the new concepts[1][2].\n- **Tutorial:** Refer to the \"A Step-by-Step Tutorial on Active Inference and its Application to Empirical Data\" by Ryan Smith, Karl Friston, and Christopher Whyte. This tutorial provides a detailed walkthrough of the mathematical basis and practical applications of Active Inference[4].\n\n**Initial Learning Objectives:**\n- Understand the fundamentals of Active Inference, including the Free Energy Principle (FEP).\n- Learn how Active Inference applies to biological systems and synthetic agents.\n- Familiarize yourself with the Bayesian inference and variational inference concepts.\n\n**Concrete Actions to Take:**\n- Watch the video lecture and take notes on key concepts such as first principles AI, the impact of FEP on personal experiences, and applications of Active Inference.\n- Complete the first few sections of the tutorial to grasp the basic mathematical and theoretical underpinnings.\n- Join online forums or discussion groups related to Active Inference (e.g., Reddit's r/MachineLearning or specialized Active Inference groups) to engage with the community and ask initial questions.\n\n#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)\n\n**Key Concepts to Master:**\n- **Free Energy Principle:** Delve deeper into the FEP and its role in Active Inference. Read Karl Friston\u2019s paper \"A free energy principle for biological systems\"[4].\n- **Bayesian Inference and Variational Inference:** Study these concepts in the context of Active Inference. Use resources like the tutorial mentioned above and additional papers such as \"Learning and inference in the brain\" by Karl Friston[4].\n- **Generative Models:** Understand how generative models are used in Active Inference. Refer to the project on \"Learning Where to Park by Active Inference\" which demonstrates the use of generative models in a real-world setting[3].\n\n**Practical Exercises or Projects:**\n- **Simulations:** Use probabilistic programming tools like ForneyLab or Turing to simulate simple Active Inference scenarios. This can be done using the examples provided in the tutorial or the parking robot project[3][4].\n- **Software Tools:** Familiarize yourself with the RXinfer Toolbox and other software tools developed by the BIASlab. Participate in or lead a project to develop more user-friendly tools for Active Inference[1][2].\n\n**Recommended Study Materials:**\n- **Academic Papers:**\n  - \"Action understanding and active inference\" by Karl Friston, J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Mattout, and James Kilner[4].\n  - \"Reinforcement learning or active inference?\" by Karl J Friston, Jean Daunizeau, and Stefan J Kiebel[4].\n- **Online Courses:**\n  - Look for online courses or workshops that focus on Bayesian machine learning and Active Inference. Platforms like Coursera, edX, or specialized AI courses might have relevant content.\n\n**Community Engagement Opportunities:**\n- **Workshops and Conferences:** Attend workshops or conferences related to Active Inference and computational neuroscience. For example, the annual conferences on Computational Psychiatry or the meetings organized by the BIASlab.\n- **Collaborations:** Reach out to other researchers in the field, such as those from the BIASlab or collaborators of Karl Friston, to discuss potential collaboration opportunities.\n\n#### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)\n\n**Advanced Topics to Explore:**\n- **Deep Active Inference:** Study the application of deep neural networks in Active Inference. This involves understanding how to scale up Active Inference using learned maps and amortised probabilistic distributions[4].\n- **Continuous and Discrete Active Inference:** Delve into the differences and applications of continuous and discrete state-space models in Active Inference[4].\n\n**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**\n- **Industry-Academia Partnerships:** Collaborate with industry partners, such as GN Hearing, to apply Active Inference in real-world applications like hearing aids or other medical devices.\n- **Interdisciplinary Projects:** Work on projects that integrate Active Inference with other domains like robotics, engineering, or medicine. For example, developing an Active Inference agent for a robot to navigate and learn in a dynamic environment[3].\n\n**Application Projects in Their Domain:**\n- **Audio Processing:** Apply Active Inference to improve audio processing in hearing aids. This involves developing agents that can adapt to changing acoustic environments without user intervention[2].\n- **Robotics:** Work on a project to develop an Active Inference agent for a robot that needs to learn and navigate to a target location, similar to the parking robot project[3].\n\n**Skill-Building Activities:**\n- **Coding Projects:** Engage in coding projects that implement Active Inference algorithms. Use languages like Julia or Python and frameworks like RXinfer Toolbox.\n- **Mathematical Development:** Continuously deepen your understanding of the mathematical underpinnings of Active Inference.
