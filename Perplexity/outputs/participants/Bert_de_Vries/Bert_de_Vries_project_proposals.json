What are you trying to do?\nDevelop an Active Inference-based system for hearing aids that can adapt to changing acoustic environments without user intervention, providing a more seamless and personalized auditory experience.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrently, hearing aids often require manual adjustments by the user to adapt to different environments. This can be cumbersome and may not always result in optimal settings. The current practice relies heavily on pre-programmed settings and limited real-time adaptation.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThe new approach involves implementing Active Inference agents that use Bayesian inference and generative models to predict and adapt to the user's auditory environment in real-time. This is based on the Free Energy Principle, which allows the agent to minimize prediction errors and optimize settings dynamically. The success of this approach is rooted in its ability to learn from user feedback and adapt seamlessly, leveraging Bert de Vries' expertise in signal processing and machine learning.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nUsers of hearing aids, particularly those in dynamic environments, will benefit significantly from this technology. It will improve their auditory experience, reduce the need for manual adjustments, and enhance overall satisfaction.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\n- **Technical Challenges**: Integrating Active Inference into existing hearing aid technology could be complex.\n- **User Acceptance**: Users may need time to adjust to the new adaptive features.\n- **Data Privacy**: Ensuring that user feedback data is handled securely.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThe initial development cost will be moderate, focusing on software development and integration with existing hardware. Estimated costs include:\n- Software development: $50,000 - $100,000\n- Testing and validation: $20,000 - $30,000\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\nThis project is expected to take approximately 3-6 months to complete, including development, testing, and initial deployment.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Mid-term Checkpoint (2 months)**: Successful simulation of the Active Inference agent in a controlled environment.\n- **Final Checkpoint (6 months)**: Deployment and user testing of the adaptive hearing aid system.\n\n### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Active Inference for Robotic Navigation\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nDevelop an Active Inference-based navigation system for robots that can learn and adapt to dynamic environments, ensuring efficient and safe navigation.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrent robotic navigation systems often rely on pre-mapped environments or require extensive training data. These systems can be rigid and fail to adapt to unforeseen changes or new environments.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThe new approach involves using Active Inference agents that build and update generative models of the environment in real-time. This allows the robot to predict and adapt to changes, minimizing prediction errors and optimizing navigation. The success of this approach is based on the robustness of Active Inference in handling complex, dynamic environments, leveraging Bert de Vries' expertise in machine learning and signal processing.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nThis technology will significantly impact industries such as logistics, manufacturing, and healthcare, where robotic navigation is critical. It will enhance the efficiency, safety, and adaptability of robotic systems.\n\n#### 5.

What are you trying to do?\nDevelop a comprehensive and standardized framework for integrating Active Inference agents in multi-agent systems, enabling complex interactions and efficient information exchange across various domains such as robotics, healthcare, and engineering.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrently, multi-agent systems often use simplified models borrowed from reinforcement learning, which may not fully capture the complexity of interactions or allow for conditional communication. This leads to limitations in scalability and adaptability.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThe new approach involves developing Reactive Environments as introduced by W. W. L. Nuijten and Bert de Vries, which facilitate complex multi-agent communication and information exchange. This framework uses a reactive programming style, allowing for efficient and robust interactions between agents and their environments. The success of this approach is rooted in its ability to standardize and enhance the interaction models, leveraging the expertise in Active Inference, Bayesian machine learning, and signal processing.\n\n#### 4.
