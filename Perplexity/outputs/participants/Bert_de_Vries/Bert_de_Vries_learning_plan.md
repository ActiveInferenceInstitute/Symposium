### Detailed Learning Plan for Bert de Vries on Active Inference

#### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Video Lecture:** Start with Dr. Bert De Vries' own lecture on "Active Inference & First Principles AI" to get a comprehensive introduction to the subject. This will help align his existing knowledge with the new concepts[1][2].
- **Tutorial:** Refer to the "A Step-by-Step Tutorial on Active Inference and its Application to Empirical Data" by Ryan Smith, Karl Friston, and Christopher Whyte. This tutorial provides a detailed walkthrough of the mathematical basis and practical applications of Active Inference[4].

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the fundamentals of Active Inference, including the Free Energy Principle (FEP).
- Learn how Active Inference applies to biological systems and synthetic agents.
- Familiarize yourself with the Bayesian inference and variational inference concepts.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Watch the video lecture and take notes on key concepts such as first principles AI, the impact of FEP on personal experiences, and applications of Active Inference.
- Complete the first few sections of the tutorial to grasp the basic mathematical and theoretical underpinnings.
- Join online forums or discussion groups related to Active Inference (e.g., Reddit's r/MachineLearning or specialized Active Inference groups) to engage with the community and ask initial questions.

#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Free Energy Principle:** Delve deeper into the FEP and its role in Active Inference. Read Karl Friston’s paper "A free energy principle for biological systems"[4].
- **Bayesian Inference and Variational Inference:** Study these concepts in the context of Active Inference. Use resources like the tutorial mentioned above and additional papers such as "Learning and inference in the brain" by Karl Friston[4].
- **Generative Models:** Understand how generative models are used in Active Inference. Refer to the project on "Learning Where to Park by Active Inference" which demonstrates the use of generative models in a real-world setting[3].

**Practical Exercises or Projects:**
- **Simulations:** Use probabilistic programming tools like ForneyLab or Turing to simulate simple Active Inference scenarios. This can be done using the examples provided in the tutorial or the parking robot project[3][4].
- **Software Tools:** Familiarize yourself with the RXinfer Toolbox and other software tools developed by the BIASlab. Participate in or lead a project to develop more user-friendly tools for Active Inference[1][2].

**Recommended Study Materials:**
- **Academic Papers:**
  - "Action understanding and active inference" by Karl Friston, Jérémie Mattout, and James Kilner[4].
  - "Reinforcement learning or active inference?" by Karl J Friston, Jean Daunizeau, and Stefan J Kiebel[4].
- **Online Courses:**
  - Look for online courses or workshops that focus on Bayesian machine learning and Active Inference. Platforms like Coursera, edX, or specialized AI courses might have relevant content.

**Community Engagement Opportunities:**
- **Workshops and Conferences:** Attend workshops or conferences related to Active Inference and computational neuroscience. For example, the annual conferences on Computational Psychiatry or the meetings organized by the BIASlab.
- **Collaborations:** Reach out to other researchers in the field, such as those from the BIASlab or collaborators of Karl Friston, to discuss potential collaboration opportunities.

#### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)

**Advanced Topics to Explore:**
- **Deep Active Inference:** Study the application of deep neural networks in Active Inference. This involves understanding how to scale up Active Inference using learned maps and amortised probabilistic distributions[4].
- **Continuous and Discrete Active Inference:** Delve into the differences and applications of continuous and discrete state-space models in Active Inference[4].

**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**
- **Industry-Academia Partnerships:** Collaborate with industry partners, such as GN Hearing, to apply Active Inference in real-world applications like hearing aids or other medical devices.
- **Interdisciplinary Projects:** Work on projects that integrate Active Inference with other domains like robotics, engineering, or medicine. For example, developing an Active Inference agent for a robot to navigate and learn in a dynamic environment[3].

**Application Projects in Their Domain:**
- **Audio Processing:** Apply Active Inference to improve audio processing in hearing aids. This involves developing agents that can adapt to changing acoustic environments without user intervention[2].
- **Robotics:** Work on a project to develop an Active Inference agent for a robot that needs to learn and navigate to a target location, similar to the parking robot project[3].

**Skill-Building Activities:**
- **Coding Projects:** Engage in coding projects that implement Active Inference algorithms. Use languages like Julia or Python and frameworks like RXinfer Toolbox.
- **Mathematical Development:** Continuously deepen your understanding of the mathematical underpinnings of Active Inference. This might involve reading advanced papers and participating in mathematical workshops.
