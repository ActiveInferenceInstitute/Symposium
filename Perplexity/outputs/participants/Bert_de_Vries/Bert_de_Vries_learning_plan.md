### Personalized Learning Plan for Bert de Vries on Active Inference

#### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Podcast and Video Lectures:**
  - Start with the Spatial Web AI podcast featuring Dr. Bert De Vries himself, specifically the episodes on "Active Inference and its Applications" and "Advantages over deep learning"[2][3].
  - Watch the video lecture by Dr. De Vries on "Active Inference & First Principles AI" to get a comprehensive introduction to the topic[3].

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the fundamental principles of Active Inference, including the Free Energy Principle.
- Familiarize yourself with the concept of variational inference and its role in Active Inference.
- Learn about the applications of Active Inference in robotics and audio processing.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Read the introduction and key chapters of the MSc thesis on "Learning Where to Park by Active Inference" to understand practical implementations[1].
- Explore the RXinfer Toolbox and other probabilistic programming tools mentioned, such as ForneyLab and Turing, to get hands-on experience with the software[1][2].

#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Bayesian Inference and Generative Models:**
  - Delve deeper into Bayesian inference and generative models, which are central to Active Inference.
  - Study the paper "Learning and inference in the brain" by Karl Friston to understand the neuroscientific basis of Active Inference[4].

**Practical Exercises or Projects:**
- **Simulation Projects:**
  - Use probabilistic programming tools like ForneyLab or Turing to simulate simple Active Inference agents in controlled environments.
  - Implement a basic Active Inference model using MATLAB or Python, following tutorials such as "A Step-by-Step Tutorial on Active Inference and its Application to Empirical Data"[4].

**Recommended Study Materials:**
- **Tutorials and Papers:**
  - Read "A Step-by-Step Tutorial on Active Inference and its Application to Empirical Data" by Ryan Smith, Karl Friston, and Christopher Whyte[4].
  - Go through "Action understanding and active inference" by Karl Friston, Jérémie Mattout, and James Kilner to understand action inference[4].

**Community Engagement Opportunities:**
- **Workshops and Conferences:**
  - Participate in or follow online workshops and conferences focused on Active Inference and Bayesian machine learning.
  - Engage with the Active Inference community through forums or discussion groups, such as those linked to BIASlab or the RXinfer Toolbox[2][5].

#### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)

**Advanced Topics to Explore:**
- **Deep Active Inference:**
  - Study the application of deep neural networks in Active Inference, focusing on how to scale up probabilistic distributions with learned maps[4].
