### Project Proposal 1: Implementing Active Inference in a Simple Car Racing Game

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create a simple car racing game using Active Inference to control the car's movements and decision-making, demonstrating the application of Active Inference in a more complex environment than grid worlds or mazes.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, Active Inference is often demonstrated in simple grid worlds or mazes. However, scaling to more complex environments like car racing games is challenging due to the increased complexity of state and action spaces. Existing approaches often struggle with balancing exploration and exploitation, and the computational demands are high.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will utilize the RxInfer framework and incorporate Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for perception and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) for decision-making. The approach will also involve optimizing the free energy minimization process to handle the increased complexity of the car racing environment. Success is anticipated due to the structured learning plan and the use of pre-built platforms like RxInfer, which provide a solid foundation for scaling Active Inference models.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will demonstrate the feasibility of applying Active Inference to more complex, real-world-like scenarios, which could inspire further research and applications in fields like robotics and autonomous vehicles. It will also help in developing more practical tools and resources for the Active Inference community.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Scalability Issues**: The project may still face scalability issues, despite using optimized methods.
- **Computational Demands**: High computational demands could pose a challenge.
- **Limited Generalizability**: The solution might not generalize well to other complex environments.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project will primarily require computational resources and time. No significant additional costs are anticipated, as it will leverage existing frameworks and tools.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 1-3 months, depending on the complexity of the car racing game and the optimization required.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Week 1-2**: Set up the development environment and implement basic Active Inference components.
- **Month 1**: Implement VAE-based perception and MDPs for decision-making.
- **Month 2-3**: Optimize and refine the model to handle the car racing game environment.
- **Final Checkpoint**: Successfully run and evaluate the car racing game controlled by Active Inference.

### Project Proposal 2: Developing an Active Inference Framework for Autonomous Vehicles

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a comprehensive framework for applying Active Inference in autonomous vehicle decision-making systems, integrating it with existing deep learning techniques for perception and control.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current autonomous vehicle systems often rely on deep learning and traditional control algorithms. However, these systems lack the integrated perception and action framework that Active Inference provides. The limits include the inability to handle complex, dynamic environments and the lack of a unified theory for decision-making.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will integrate Active Inference with deep learning techniques for perception and control, using RxInfer and custom-built VAEs. The approach will leverage the free energy principle to optimize decision-making in dynamic environments. Success is expected due to the combination of robust perception systems with the theoretical foundations of Active Inference.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will lead to more robust and adaptive autonomous vehicle systems, enhancing safety and efficiency. It will also contribute to the broader adoption of Active Inference in real-world applications, particularly in the automotive industry.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Integration Challenges**: Integrating Active Inference with deep learning could be complex.
- **Scalability and Computational Demands**: Handling real-world data and environments may pose significant computational challenges.
- **Regulatory and Safety Concerns**: Ensuring the system meets safety and regulatory standards will be crucial.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project will require significant computational resources, potentially specialized hardware for simulations, and collaboration with experts from the automotive and AI fields. Estimated costs include software licenses, hardware upgrades, and potential collaboration fees.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 6-12 months, considering the complexity of integrating different AI approaches and the need for extensive testing and validation.

Develop an open-source platform that facilitates the application of Active Inference across various disciplines, including neuroscience, robotics, and autonomous systems, providing a user-friendly interface and extensive documentation.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, Active Inference is applied in a fragmented manner, with different researchers and practitioners using various custom-built solutions. The lack of a unified, accessible platform hinders widespread adoption and collaboration.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will create an open-source platform leveraging RxInfer and other existing tools, with a focus on usability, documentation, and community engagement. The platform will include pre-built components for perception, decision-making, and optimization, making it easier for new users to adopt Active Inference. Success is anticipated due to the collaborative nature of the project and the potential for community-driven improvements.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will democratize access to Active Inference, enabling researchers and practitioners from diverse fields to apply and contribute to the theory. It will foster a more collaborative and innovative community, leading to broader and more impactful applications.
