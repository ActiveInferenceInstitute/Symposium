### Background Analysis: Expertise and Experience

Carlos Borlado has a strong foundation in physics, holding a PhD in the field, which indicates a solid understanding of theoretical and analytical skills. His experience as a technology consultant and the founder of several startups suggests he is adept at translating theoretical knowledge into practical applications and has entrepreneurial and problem-solving skills. However, the specific details of his work in physics and the startups he has founded are not provided, so it is difficult to pinpoint exactly how his background in physics directly relates to his current interests in Active Inference.

### Active Inference Journey: Current Understanding and Application Stage

Carlos Borlado has attempted to apply Active Inference but faces significant challenges in moving beyond simple examples. He has successfully reproduced basic scenarios such as grid worlds and mazes but encounters exponential complexity when trying to transition to more complex environments, like simple car racing games. This indicates that while he has a basic understanding of Active Inference principles, he is struggling with the scalability and complexity inherent in more real-world applications. Currently, he is not actively applying Active Inference in any projects.
