These resources are available on various platforms, including YouTube and the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging website.\n  - [Karl Friston's Lectures on Active Inference]\n- **Active Inference Institute Materials**: Explore the resources and publications available on the Active Inference Institute website. This includes articles, tutorials, and research papers.\n  - [Active Inference Institute]\n\n**Initial Learning Objectives:**\n- Understand the basic principles of Active Inference.\n- Familiarize yourself with the mathematical formulations and conceptual frameworks.\n- Identify key applications and domains where Active Inference is used.\n\n**Concrete Actions to Take:**\n- Watch the introductory lectures by Karl Friston.\n- Read the introductory chapters or articles on the Active Inference Institute website.\n- Join online forums or discussion groups related to Active Inference to get a feel for the community and current discussions.\n\n#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)\n\n**Key Concepts to Master:**\n- **Free Energy Principle**: Understand the foundational concept of the Free Energy Principle and how it relates to Active Inference.\n- **Bayesian Inference**: Delve into the Bayesian framework and its application in Active Inference.\n- **Predictive Coding**: Study the role of predictive coding in Active Inference models.\n\n**Practical Exercises or Projects:**\n- Implement simple Active Inference models using software frameworks like MATLAB or Python.\n  - Use the `SPM` software package developed by the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, which includes tools for Active Inference.\n- Work on a small project that applies Active Inference to a simple problem, such as a perceptual task or a basic decision-making scenario.\n\n**Recommended Study Materials:**\n- **\"Life as we know it\" by Karl Friston**: A comprehensive article that outlines the principles of Active Inference and its broader implications.\n- **\"Active Inference: A Process Theory\" by Friston et al.**: A detailed paper that explains the theoretical underpinnings of Active Inference.\n\n**Community Engagement Opportunities:**\n- Attend webinars or online seminars hosted by institutions like the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging.\n- Participate in online forums such as the Active Inference subreddit or specialized groups on LinkedIn.\n\n#### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)\n\n**Advanced Topics to Explore:**\n- **Active Inference in Cognitive Science**: Study how Active Inference is applied in cognitive science, including decision-making, perception, and action.\n- **Neural Implementation**: Investigate how Active Inference is implemented in neural networks and the brain.\n- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Explore the application of Active Inference in multi-agent systems and social cognition.\n\n**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**\n- Reach out to researchers in your network or through professional platforms like LinkedIn or ResearchGate to collaborate on projects.\n- Join research groups or labs that are actively working on Active Inference projects.\n\n**Application Projects in Their Domain:**\n- Apply Active Inference to a specific problem within your domain of expertise. For example, if you are working in AI research, integrate Active Inference into your existing projects to enhance decision-making or perception models.\n- Collaborate with other researchers to develop innovative applications of Active Inference.\n\n**Skill-Building Activities:**\n- Take advanced courses or tutorials on computational neuroscience, Bayesian inference, and machine learning to deepen your understanding.\n  - [Coursera - Computational Neuroscience by University of Washington]\n  - [edX - Bayesian Inference by Microsoft]\n\n#### SPECIFIC RESOURCES\n\n**Active Inference Institute Materials:**\n- [Active Inference Institute]\n- [Karl Friston's Publications]\n\n**Academic Papers and Tutorials:**\n- **\"Life as we know it\" by Karl Friston**\n- **\"Active Inference: A Process Theory\" by Friston et al.**\n- **\"Active Inference and Bayesian Filtering\" by Friston et al.**\n\n**Software Tools and Frameworks:**\n- **SPM Software Package** by the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging\n- **MATLAB and Python Libraries for Active Inference** (e.g., `spm_free_energy` package)\n\n**Community Resources and Events:**\n- **Active Inference Subreddit**\n- **Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging Webinars**\n- **Active Inference Conferences and Workshops**\n\n#### PROGRESS TRACKING\n\n**Milestones and Checkpoints:**\n- Complete the introductory lectures and tutorials within the first month.\n- Implement a simple Active Inference model within the first three months.\n- Present a project or research idea to the community within six months.\n\n**Self-Assessment Methods:**\n- Regularly review and reflect on your understanding of key concepts.\n- Participate in peer review sessions or discussion groups to get feedback on your projects.\n\n**Practical Application Opportunities:**\n- Apply Active Inference to a real-world problem or a research project.\n- Collaborate with other researchers to integrate Active Inference into their projects.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis learning plan is tailored to Petter Hoerling's background and interests, focusing on practical and theoretical aspects of Active Inference. By following these steps, he can deepen his understanding, enhance his application skills, and engage actively with the community.\n\n---\n\n### References\n - Karl Friston's Lectures on Active Inference (YouTube)\n - Active Inference Institute\n - \"Life as we know it\" by Karl Friston\n - \"Active Inference: A Process Theory\" by Friston et al.\n - Coursera - Computational Neuroscience by University of Washington\n - edX - Bayesian Inference by Microsoft\n - Karl Friston's Publications\n - \"Active Inference and Bayesian Filtering\" by Friston et al.",
