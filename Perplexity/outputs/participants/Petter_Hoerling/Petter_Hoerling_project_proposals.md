### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Implementing a Simple Active Inference Model

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Implement a simple Active Inference model to understand and demonstrate the basic principles of Active Inference in a controlled environment.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, Active Inference models are often complex and require a deep understanding of Bayesian inference, predictive coding, and the Free Energy Principle. The limits of current practice include the steep learning curve and the need for extensive mathematical and computational background. Simple implementations are rare and often lack practical applicability.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will use existing software frameworks like the `SPM` software package developed by the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging to simplify the implementation process. By focusing on a simple perceptual task or a basic decision-making scenario, the project will make Active Inference more accessible and provide a clear, practical example of its application.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will help Petter Hoerling and other beginners in the field to gain a practical understanding of Active Inference. It will also provide a teaching tool for workshops and educational materials, making the concept more approachable for a broader audience.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the potential for misinterpretation of the model's results due to oversimplification and the difficulty in scaling the model to more complex tasks.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will not require significant financial investment, as it will utilize free or open-source software and resources available online.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take about 1-3 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the task chosen.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint**: Complete the initial implementation of the model within the first month.
  - **Final Checkpoint**: Present the working model and its results to the community or in a research setting within three months.
  - **Collaborators/Resources**: Karl Friston's tutorials, `SPM` software package, and online forums related to Active Inference.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Active Inference in Cognitive Science Applications

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Apply Active Inference to cognitive science problems, specifically in decision-making and perception tasks, to enhance our understanding of human cognition and develop more accurate models.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, cognitive science models often rely on traditional statistical methods or simpler AI techniques. The limits include the lack of integration with Bayesian inference and predictive coding, which are central to Active Inference. Existing models may not fully capture the complexity of human cognition.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will integrate Active Inference principles with cognitive science models, leveraging the Free Energy Principle to better explain decision-making and perception. By using advanced computational tools and collaborating with cognitive scientists, the project aims to develop more robust and realistic models.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success will contribute significantly to the field of cognitive science by providing more accurate and comprehensive models of human cognition. This can have implications for fields like psychology, neuroscience, and AI research.

#### 5. What are the risks?
Risks include the complexity of integrating Active Inference with existing cognitive models, potential resistance from the cognitive science community to new methodologies, and the challenge of validating the models experimentally.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project may require some funding for software, computational resources, and potentially collaborating with other researchers. Estimated costs could range from $5,000 to $20,000, depending on the scope.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take around 6-12 months to complete, including literature review, model development, and initial validation.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint**: Complete a literature review and initial model development within the first three months.
  - **Mid-term Checkpoint**: Conduct preliminary simulations and validate the model against existing data within six months.
  - **Final Checkpoint**: Present the final results and validated models in a research paper or conference within 12 months.
  - **Collaborators/Resources**: Cognitive scientists, computational neuroscientists, `SPM` software package, and relevant journals and conferences.

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Active Inference in Multi-Agent Systems and Social Cognition

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and apply Active Inference to multi-agent systems and social cognition to understand and model complex social interactions and decision-making processes.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, multi-agent systems and social cognition models often use simplistic or ad-hoc approaches to model interactions. The limits include the lack of a unified theoretical framework that incorporates Bayesian inference and predictive coding, leading to models that do not fully capture the complexity of social interactions.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will extend Active Inference to multi-agent systems by integrating the Free Energy Principle with social cognition theories. By developing a comprehensive framework that accounts for the interactions and feedback loops in social systems, the project aims to create more realistic and predictive models of social behavior.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success will significantly impact fields such as social psychology, sociology, economics, and AI research by providing a robust theoretical framework for understanding and modeling complex social interactions. This could lead to better decision-making tools in social and economic contexts.

#### 5. What are the risks?
Risks include the high complexity of the task, potential difficulties in scaling the model to large social systems, and the challenge of validating the model experimentally or through real-world data.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will likely require substantial funding for extensive research, computational resources, and potentially collaborations with multiple researchers across different fields. Estimated costs could range from $50,000 to $200,000 or more, depending on the scope and duration.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take around 1-3 years to complete, including extensive literature review, model development, simulation, validation, and refinement.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint**: Complete a comprehensive literature review and initial model development within the first six months.
  - **Mid-term Checkpoint**: Conduct extensive simulations and preliminary validation within the first year.
  - **Mid-term Checkpoint**: Refine the model based on feedback and additional data within 18 months.
  - **Final Checkpoint**: Present the final results and validated models in a series of research papers or conferences within 2-3 years.
  - **Collaborators/Resources**: Researchers in social psychology, sociology, economics, computational neuroscientists, `SPM` software package, and relevant journals and conferences.
