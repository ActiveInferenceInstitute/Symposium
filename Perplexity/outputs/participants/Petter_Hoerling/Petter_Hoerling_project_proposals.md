### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Implementing a Simple Active Inference Model for Climate Data Analysis

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
- Develop and implement a simple Active Inference model to analyze and predict climate data, specifically focusing on temperature variability.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
- Currently, climate data analysis often relies on traditional statistical models and machine learning techniques. However, these methods may not fully capture the complex interactions and decision-making processes inherent in climate systems. The limits include the lack of a unified framework that integrates perception, action, and learning.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
- The new approach involves using Active Inference, which integrates control theory, Bayesian inference, and neuroscience to model how climate systems respond to various inputs. This framework can potentially capture the dynamic and adaptive nature of climate systems more effectively than current methods. Success is likely because Active Inference has shown promise in modeling complex systems in other domains.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
- Climate scientists, policymakers, and anyone involved in climate modeling and prediction will benefit from this project. By providing a more accurate and adaptive model, it can improve climate predictions and decision-making processes, ultimately contributing to better climate management and policy.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- The main risks include the complexity of implementing Active Inference models, the need for significant computational resources, and the potential for initial models to be less accurate than expected. Additionally, there is a risk of not fully understanding the theoretical underpinnings of Active Inference, which could lead to misapplication.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
- The initial cost will be minimal, primarily involving time and computational resources. Access to software tools like the `spm` MATLAB toolbox and online resources will be sufficient.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- This project is expected to take 1-3 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the model and the depth of analysis.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Month 1:** Complete the implementation of a simple Active Inference model using the `spm` MATLAB toolbox.
  - **Check Point:** Verify that the model runs without errors and produces plausible results.
- **Month 2:** Apply the model to real-world climate data and compare results with traditional models.
  - **Check Point:** Evaluate the performance of the Active Inference model against existing methods.
- **Month 3:** Refine the model based on initial results and present findings in a webinar or seminar.
  - **Check Point:** Receive feedback from the community and assess the model's predictive accuracy.

**Resources and Collaborators:**
- Utilize the `spm` MATLAB toolbox and resources from the Active Inference Institute.
- Collaborate with other researchers in the Active Inference community for feedback and support.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with Climate Models for Decision-Making

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
- Integrate Active Inference into existing climate models to enhance decision-making processes in the face of climate variability and uncertainty.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
- Current climate models use various statistical and dynamical methods to predict climate behavior, but they often lack a framework for integrating decision-making and adaptive responses. The limits include the inability to model how climate systems adapt and respond to changing conditions in a holistic manner.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
- The new approach involves integrating Active Inference into climate models, allowing for the modeling of adaptive responses and decision-making processes. This can provide a more comprehensive understanding of how climate systems respond to various inputs and how decisions can be optimized. Success is likely due to the theoretical foundations of Active Inference, which have been successful in other complex systems.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
- This project will benefit climate researchers, policymakers, and anyone involved in climate management. By providing models that can adapt and make decisions based on changing climate conditions, it can lead to more effective climate management strategies and better decision-making.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- The risks include the complexity of integrating Active Inference with existing climate models, the need for significant computational resources, and potential challenges in validating the new models. There is also a risk of resistance from the climate science community to adopting new methodologies.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
- The cost will involve time, computational resources, and potentially some funding for software licenses or collaboration with other researchers. Estimated costs could range from $10,000 to $50,000 depending on the scope.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- This project is expected to take 6-12 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the integration and the validation process.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Month 3:** Complete the theoretical integration of Active Inference with a climate model.
  - **Check Point:** Verify the theoretical soundness of the integration and ensure the model runs without errors.
- **Month 6:** Apply the integrated model to real-world climate data and compare results with existing models.

- **Month 12:** Refine the model based on feedback, publish the findings, and present the results in a conference or workshop.
  - **Check Point:** Receive feedback from the broader scientific community and assess the impact of the new approach.

**Resources and Collaborators:**
- Collaborate with researchers from both the climate science and AI communities.
- Utilize resources from the Active Inference Institute and climate modeling communities.
- Potential collaboration with institutions like the Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich or the National Center for Atmospheric Science (NCAS)[2].

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
- The new approach involves developing an Active Inference framework specifically tailored for global climate modeling. This framework will integrate control theory, Bayesian inference, and neuroscience to model how climate systems respond and adapt to various inputs and policy decisions. Success is likely due to the robust theoretical foundations of Active Inference and its potential to capture complex system dynamics.
