  "content": "### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Active Inference Modeling of Human Navigation\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nCreate a simple computational model using active inference to simulate human navigation in a controlled environment, such as a maze or a small room.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrently, human navigation is often modeled using traditional cognitive maps and pathfinding algorithms. However, these models lack the dynamic and adaptive nature of active inference, which can better capture the predictive and perceptual aspects of navigation. The limits of current practice include the inability to fully incorporate sensory feedback and the lack of a unified framework that integrates perception, action, and learning.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project will apply the principles of active inference to model human navigation. By using the free-energy principle, the model will minimize the difference between predicted and actual sensory inputs, allowing for more realistic and adaptive navigation behaviors. This approach is new because it integrates predictive processing and Bayesian inference, which can better simulate the human brain's navigation mechanisms.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nSuccess in this project will provide a more accurate and dynamic model of human navigation, which can be useful in various fields such as cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. It can also inform the development of more effective navigation systems in robotics and autonomous vehicles.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\nThe primary risk is the complexity of implementing active inference models, which may require significant computational resources and mathematical expertise. Additionally, there is a risk that the model may not capture the full complexity of human navigation behaviors.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThis project will primarily require computational resources and access to software tools like MATLAB or Python libraries. Given Andrea Hiott's existing affiliations and resources, the cost is expected to be minimal.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\nThis project should take approximately 1-2 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the model and the availability of computational resources.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Mid-term Check Point**: After one month, evaluate the initial simulations and ensure that the model is correctly implementing the free-energy principle and predictive processing.\n- **Final Check Point**: After two months, present the final model and simulation results, comparing them with existing navigation models to assess their accuracy and adaptability.\n\n**Collaborators/Resources:**\n- Daniel Ari Friedman for guidance on active inference principles.\n- Access to computational resources and software tools through the Active Inference Institute.\n\n### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Active Inference in Ecological Sustainability\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nDevelop an active inference model to predict and understand ecological behaviors in complex systems, with a focus on sustainability and environmental interaction.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrently, ecological behaviors are often modeled using traditional statistical and dynamical systems approaches. However, these models lack the integrative and adaptive capabilities of active inference, which can incorporate multiple scales and complex interactions. The limits of current practice include the inability to fully capture the predictive and perceptual aspects of ecological systems.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project will apply active inference to model ecological behaviors, integrating predictive processing, Bayesian inference, and scale-friendly frameworks. This approach is new because it will allow for a more holistic understanding of ecological systems, incorporating sensory feedback and adaptive learning mechanisms.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nSuccess in this project will provide a more accurate and adaptive model of ecological behaviors, which can be crucial for environmental sustainability and conservation efforts. It can inform policy decisions and management strategies in ecology and environmental science.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\nThe primary risks include the complexity of integrating multiple scales and the need for extensive data on ecological systems. There is also a risk that the model may not capture the full complexity of real-world ecological behaviors.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThis project will require access to ecological data, computational resources, and potentially collaboration with field experts. The cost is expected to be moderate, likely involving grants or institutional funding.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\nThis project should take approximately 3-6 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the model and the availability of data and resources.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Mid-term Check Point**: After three months, evaluate the initial model and ensure that it correctly implements the active inference principles and integrates ecological data.\n- **Final Check Point**: After six months, present the final model and compare its predictions with real-world ecological behaviors to assess its accuracy and utility.\n\n**Collaborators/Resources:**\n- Collaboration with the Ecological Motoring Initiative.\n- Access to ecological data and computational resources through the Active Inference Institute and other affiliated organizations.\n\n### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing Active Inference-Based AI Agents for Spatial Web Technologies\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nDevelop AI agents using active inference principles that can operate within the Spatial Web, enabling intelligent and adaptive interactions between digital and physical spaces.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrently, AI agents in spatial web technologies are often based on deep learning models that lack the adaptive and predictive capabilities of active inference. The limits of current practice include the inability to fully integrate sensory feedback and the lack of a unified framework that incorporates perception, action, and learning.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project will apply active inference to develop AI agents that can learn and adapt within the Spatial Web, using predictive processing and Bayesian inference to minimize free energy. This approach is new because it integrates the active inference framework with spatial web technologies, enabling more intelligent and adaptive AI agents.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nSuccess in this project will revolutionize the way AI interacts with both digital and physical spaces, enabling more efficient, adaptive, and intelligent systems. This can have significant impacts on various fields such as urban planning, smart cities, and IoT technologies.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\nThe primary risks include the complexity of integrating active inference with spatial web technologies, the need for extensive computational resources, and the potential for ethical and privacy concerns related to AI agents in physical spaces.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThis project will require significant funding for computational resources, data acquisition, and potentially collaboration with industry partners. The cost is expected to be substantial, likely involving grants, institutional funding, and industry partnerships.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\nThis project should take approximately 1-2 years to complete, depending on the complexity of the integration and the availability of resources.\n\n#### 8.
