### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Active Inference Modeling for Ecological Navigation

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create a simple Active Inference model to understand and simulate ecological navigation in a controlled environment, such as a forest or a park, to help improve the Ecological Motoring Initiative's strategies.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, ecological navigation often relies on traditional mapping techniques and GPS systems, which lack the adaptive and predictive capabilities of Active Inference. These methods do not account for dynamic environmental changes or the intrinsic uncertainty in navigation.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will utilize the Active Inference framework to create a model that predicts and adapts to environmental changes in real-time. By using predictive processing and the free-energy principle, the model will minimize uncertainty and optimize navigation paths. This approach will be successful because it leverages the robust mathematical foundations of Active Inference, which have been shown to be effective in various cognitive and perceptual tasks.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
The success of this project will significantly impact the Ecological Motoring Initiative by providing a more efficient and adaptive navigation system. This can lead to better conservation strategies, improved wildlife tracking, and enhanced environmental monitoring. It will also contribute to the broader field of ecological cognition by demonstrating the applicability of Active Inference in real-world environmental contexts.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Technical Challenges**: Implementing Active Inference models can be computationally intensive and may require significant computational resources.
- **Data Quality**: The accuracy of the model depends on high-quality environmental data, which may be challenging to obtain.
- **Interpretation**: There is a risk of misinterpreting the model's outputs if not properly validated.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
- **Software and Tools**: Utilizing existing software tools like MATLAB and SPM software, which are already available.
- **Data Collection**: Minimal costs associated with collecting environmental data, potentially using existing datasets.
- **Time and Effort**: Approximately 1-2 months of dedicated time.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- **Literature Review and Model Design**: 2 weeks
- **Implementation and Simulation**: 4 weeks
- **Validation and Reporting**: 2 weeks
Total duration: 8 weeks

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Weekly Progress Meetings**: Regular meetings to review progress, discuss challenges, and adjust the plan.
- **Monthly Milestones**:
  - Completion of literature review and model design
  - Successful implementation of the model
  - Validation and reporting of results
- **Final Report**: A comprehensive report detailing the methodology, results, and implications of the project.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with Cognitive Mapping for Ecological Cognition

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop an integrated framework that combines Active Inference with cognitive mapping theories, such as those related to the hippocampus, to enhance ecological cognition and navigation across different scales and species.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current approaches to ecological cognition often separate cognitive mapping from predictive processing. Cognitive mapping theories, like those involving the hippocampus, focus on spatial memory but do not fully incorporate the adaptive and predictive aspects of Active Inference.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project integrates the predictive processing of Active Inference with cognitive mapping theories. By using the Markov blanket and free-energy principle, the model will predict and adapt to environmental changes while leveraging the spatial memory functions of cognitive maps. This integrated approach will be successful because it combines the strengths of both frameworks, providing a more comprehensive and adaptive model for ecological cognition.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
The success of this project will significantly advance the field of ecological cognition by providing a unified framework that integrates predictive processing and cognitive mapping. This will have implications for conservation biology, environmental monitoring, and our understanding of how organisms navigate and interact with their environments.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Theoretical Integration**: Integrating two complex theories can be challenging and may require significant theoretical and mathematical work.
- **Data Integration**: Combining data from cognitive mapping studies with Active Inference models could be complicated.
- **Validation**: Validating the integrated model across different scales and species could be time-consuming and resource-intensive.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
- **Collaboration and Networking**: Potential costs associated with collaborating with experts in cognitive mapping and Active Inference.
- **Advanced Software Tools**: Utilizing advanced software tools and possibly developing new tools to integrate the two frameworks.
- **Time and Effort**: Approximately 6-9 months of dedicated time.

#### 7. How long will it take?

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a scale-friendly Active Inference framework that can be applied across various scales (from individual organisms to ecosystems) for environmental monitoring and management, integrating real-time data from IoT sensors and spatial web technologies.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current environmental monitoring systems often lack the scalability and adaptability needed to manage complex ecosystems. They typically rely on static models that do not account for dynamic changes or predictive processing.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will leverage the scale-friendly framework of Active Inference, integrating real-time data from IoT sensors and spatial web technologies like HSML and HSTP. By using predictive processing and the free-energy principle, the model will predict and adapt to environmental changes across different scales. This approach will be successful because it combines the robustness of Active Inference with the scalability of spatial web technologies, providing a comprehensive and adaptive system for environmental monitoring and management.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
The success of this project will revolutionize environmental monitoring and management by providing a scalable, adaptive, and predictive framework. This will have significant impacts on conservation efforts, ecosystem management, and our ability to respond to environmental changes in real-time.
