### Personalized Learning Plan for Ignacio Echegoyen Blanco on Active Inference

#### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Academic Papers:**
  - Start with the paper "An analytical model of active inference in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma" by Francesco Bonacina, Ignacio Echegoyen, and others. This paper is relevant to his current research and provides a concrete example of active inference in a game theory context[4].
  - Review the introductory chapters of "Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind and Brain" by Karl Friston to get a foundational understanding of the theory[5].

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the basic principles of active inference, including the free energy principle and its application in decision-making processes.
- Familiarize yourself with the mathematical formulations underlying active inference.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Read and summarize the key points of the selected papers.
- Engage in online forums or social media groups focused on active inference (e.g., the Active Inference subreddit or relevant LinkedIn groups) to ask questions and gain initial insights.
- Set up a meeting or discussion with a colleague or mentor who has expertise in the mathematical aspects of active inference to clarify any initial doubts.

#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
