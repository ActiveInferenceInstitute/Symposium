  "content": "### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with Attachment Theory in Simple Decision-Making Scenarios\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nArticulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon:\n- Develop a simple model that integrates Active Inference with Attachment theory to understand how attachment styles influence decision-making in everyday scenarios.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\n- Currently, Active Inference models focus on general decision-making processes, while Attachment theory is studied separately in psychology. The integration of these two theories is limited, and there is a lack of concrete models that show how attachment styles affect decision-making processes.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\n- This project will use the `spm_AIF` toolbox to simulate Active Inference models and incorporate parameters that reflect different attachment styles (secure, anxious, avoidant). The new approach involves:\n  - Modifying the free-energy principle to include attachment-related variables.\n  - Simulating decision-making scenarios to observe how different attachment styles impact the outcomes.\n  - The success of this approach lies in its ability to provide a quantitative framework for understanding the interplay between attachment and decision-making, which can be validated through experimental data.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\n- This project will be valuable to psychologists and neuroscientists studying attachment and decision-making. It will provide a new tool for understanding how attachment styles influence behavior, potentially leading to better therapeutic strategies.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\n- The main risk is the technical complexity of integrating two disparate theories, which might require significant adjustments to the existing Active Inference models. Additionally, there is a risk that the simulations may not accurately reflect real-world decision-making processes.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\n- This project will primarily require computational resources and access to the `spm_AIF` toolbox, which is freely available. There may be minimal costs associated with attending relevant workshops or conferences.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\n- This project is expected to take approximately 2-3 months, given the focused scope and the availability of the necessary tools and resources.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Mid-term Check Point (1 month):**\n  - Complete the literature review on Attachment theory and its potential integration with Active Inference.\n  - Modify the `spm_AIF` toolbox to include attachment-related parameters.\n- **Final Check Point (2-3 months):**\n  - Run and analyze the simulations to observe the impact of different attachment styles on decision-making.\n  - Prepare a draft manuscript for submission to a relevant journal.\n\n### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Applying Active Inference to Neurological Disorders: A Case Study on Alzheimer\u2019s Disease\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nArticulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon:\n- Develop an Active Inference model to understand and predict behavioral changes in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, leveraging Echegoyen\u2019s expertise in functional brain networks.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\n- Currently, models of Alzheimer\u2019s disease focus on structural changes in the brain but lack a comprehensive understanding of how these changes affect behavior. Active Inference models have not been extensively applied to this area, and existing models do not account for the complex network dynamics involved.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\n- This project will:\n  - Use functional brain network data to inform the parameters of the Active Inference model.\n  - Integrate Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to model decision-making in Alzheimer\u2019s patients.\n  - The new approach involves applying the free-energy principle to understand how the deterioration of brain networks affects behavioral outcomes. Success is likely due to the integration of Echegoyen\u2019s expertise in functional brain networks and the theoretical framework of Active Inference.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\n- This project will be significant for neuroscientists, clinicians, and patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. It could provide new insights into the behavioral manifestations of the disease and potentially lead to more personalized treatment strategies.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\n- The main risks include the complexity of integrating brain network data into Active Inference models and the need for large datasets to validate the model. There is also a risk that the model may not capture the full range of behavioral changes observed in Alzheimer\u2019s patients.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\n- This project may require access to clinical datasets, which could involve collaboration with hospitals or research institutions. There may be costs associated with data acquisition, computational resources, and potentially attending relevant conferences.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\n- This project is expected to take approximately 6-9 months, considering the need to collect and analyze data, develop the model, and validate the results.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Mid-term Check Point (3 months):**\n  - Complete the data collection and preliminary analysis of functional brain networks in Alzheimer\u2019s patients.\n  - Develop a basic Active Inference model incorporating MDPs.\n- **Final Check Point (6-9 months):**\n  - Run and analyze the simulations to predict behavioral changes in Alzheimer\u2019s patients.\n  - Prepare a draft manuscript for submission to a relevant journal and present the findings at a conference.\n\n### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing a Multilayer Active Inference Model for Complex Social Networks\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nArticulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon:\n- Develop a multilayer Active Inference model to understand and predict behavior in complex social networks, such as those involving multiple forms of social interaction (e.g., online and offline).\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\n- Current Active Inference models are typically applied to individual decision-making or simple social interactions. There is a lack of models that can handle the complexity of multilayer social networks, where individuals interact through various channels.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\n- This project will:\n  - Extend the Active Inference framework to incorporate multilayer network analysis, similar to Echegoyen\u2019s work on functional brain networks.\n  - Use advanced computational methods, such as machine learning techniques, to handle the complexity of multilayer networks.\n  - The success of this approach lies in its ability to capture the intricate interactions within social networks, providing a more comprehensive understanding of social behavior.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\n- This project will be significant for social scientists, network theorists, and anyone interested in understanding complex social behaviors. It could lead to new insights into how social networks influence behavior and potentially inform strategies for social intervention and policy-making.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\n- The main risks include the technical complexity of developing a multilayer Active Inference model, the need for large and diverse datasets, and the potential for the model to be overly complex and difficult to interpret.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\n- This project will require significant computational resources, access to large datasets, and potentially collaboration with experts in social network analysis. There may be costs associated with data acquisition, attending conferences, and workshops.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\n- This project is expected to take approximately 1-2 years, considering the complexity of the model, the need for extensive data collection and analysis, and the validation of the results.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Mid-term Check Point (6 months):**\n  - Develop the theoretical framework for the multilayer Active Inference model.\n  - Collect and preprocess the necessary datasets.\n- **Final Check Point (1-2 years):**\n  - Implement and validate the multilayer Active Inference model using the collected data.\n  - Prepare a comprehensive manuscript for submission to a high-impact journal and present the findings at a major conference.\n  - Organize a workshop or seminar to share the model and gather feedback from the broader research community.",
