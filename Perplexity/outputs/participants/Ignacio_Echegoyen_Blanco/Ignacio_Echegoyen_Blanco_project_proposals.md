### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Simulating Active Inference in Decision-Making

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
The objective is to simulate and analyze a simple active inference model in a decision-making context to understand the basic principles and mathematical formulations of active inference.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, active inference models are simulated using specialized software like SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping). However, many researchers, especially those new to the field, face challenges in understanding the technical and mathematical details. The limits include the lack of accessible tutorials and the complexity of the software.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will involve creating a step-by-step guide and tutorial on simulating a simple active inference model using SPM software. The approach will be new because it will integrate detailed explanations of the mathematical formulations with practical steps, making it more accessible to new researchers. Success is likely because it will fill a gap in current resources by providing a clear, hands-on guide.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will benefit researchers and students new to active inference by providing a clear and practical introduction to the field. It will also aid in the dissemination of active inference principles, making the theory more accessible and encouraging more researchers to engage with it.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risk is the complexity of the mathematical formulations, which might make the tutorial too dense or difficult to follow. Additionally, there is a risk that the guide might not cover all the necessary aspects, leading to incomplete understanding.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require minimal costs, primarily involving time and access to SPM software, which is already available.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take about 1-2 months to complete, including the creation of the tutorial, testing, and feedback from peers.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint:** Complete a draft of the tutorial within 4 weeks.
  - Review and feedback from at least two peers.
  - Test the tutorial with a small group of students or junior researchers.
- **Final Checkpoint:** Publish the tutorial on a relevant platform (e.g., GitHub, research blog) within 8 weeks.
  - Gather feedback from a broader audience and make necessary revisions.

**Collaborators/Resources:**
- Karl Friston's tutorials on SPM website
- Online forums like the Active Inference subreddit
- Colleagues or mentors with expertise in active inference

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with Attachment Theory

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
The objective is to integrate active inference with attachment theory by developing a theoretical framework and conducting experiments to test its validity.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, active inference and attachment theory are studied separately. The integration of these two theories is limited by the lack of a clear theoretical framework and the complexity of designing experiments that can capture the nuances of both theories.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will involve developing a new theoretical framework that combines active inference and attachment theory. The approach will be novel because it will provide a structured way to understand how attachment styles influence decision-making processes through the lens of active inference. Success is likely because it leverages Ignacio Echegoyen's existing work on attachment theory and active inference, and it addresses a significant gap in the current literature.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will be significant for researchers in psychology and neuroscience, as it will provide a new perspective on how attachment styles influence cognitive and behavioral processes. It will also contribute to the broader integration of active inference into psychological theories.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of integrating two complex theories, the challenge of designing experiments that can capture the interactions between attachment styles and active inference, and the potential for mixed results that may not support the hypothesized framework.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require moderate costs, including funding for experiments, participant compensation, and potentially some software or equipment.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take about 6-9 months to complete, including the development of the theoretical framework, experimental design, data collection, and analysis.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint:** Develop a draft of the theoretical framework and experimental design within 3 months.
  - Present the framework at a local seminar or workshop to gather feedback.
  - Begin data collection.
- **Final Checkpoint:** Complete data analysis and submit a manuscript to a relevant journal within 9 months.
  - Gather feedback from peers and make necessary revisions before submission.

**Collaborators/Resources:**
- Colleagues with expertise in attachment theory
- Researchers in the active inference community
- Access to experimental facilities and participant pools

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing a Multiscale Active Inference Model for Neurological Disorders

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
The objective is to develop a multiscale active inference model that spans neural, behavioral, and cognitive levels to understand and predict the progression of neurological disorders such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, active inference models are often applied at a single scale (e.g., neural or behavioral) and lack the integration across multiple scales. This limitation hampers the comprehensive understanding of complex neurological disorders.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will involve developing a novel multiscale active inference model that integrates data from neuroimaging (e.g., fMRI, EEG), behavioral experiments, and cognitive assessments. The approach will be groundbreaking because it will provide a holistic view of how active inference processes are disrupted in neurological disorders. Success is likely because it leverages Ignacio Echegoyen's expertise in functional brain networks and active inference, and it addresses a critical need for more comprehensive models in neuroscience.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will be crucial for researchers and clinicians working on neurological disorders. It will provide a new framework for understanding the pathophysiology of these disorders and could lead to better diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of integrating data across multiple scales, the challenge of validating the model with real-world data, and the potential for significant computational and analytical challenges.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require substantial costs, including funding for data collection (neuroimaging, behavioral experiments), software and computational resources, and potentially collaboration with multiple institutions.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take about 12-18 months to complete, including the development of the theoretical framework, data collection, model development, and validation.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint 1:** Develop a draft of the theoretical framework within 4 months.
  - Present the framework at an international conference to gather feedback.
- **Mid-term Checkpoint 2:** Complete data collection and initial model development within 9 months.
  - Test the model with a subset of data to validate its performance.
- **Final Checkpoint:** Complete model validation and submit a manuscript to a high-impact journal within 18 months.
  - Gather feedback from peers and make necessary revisions before submission.

**Collaborators/Resources:**
- Researchers in neuroscience and neuroimaging
- Clinicians specializing in neurological disorders
- Access to neuroimaging facilities and computational resources
- Collaboration with institutions like the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging
