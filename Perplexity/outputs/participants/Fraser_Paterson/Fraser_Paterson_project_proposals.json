  "content": "### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Visual Foraging Task Using Active Inference\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nCreate a simple active inference agent that can perform a visual foraging task, where the agent categorizes a scene in a hierarchical context by sequentially sampling ambiguous cues.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrently, visual foraging tasks are often modeled using simpler decision-making schemes such as drift-diffusion models. However, these models do not account for the hierarchical and uncertain nature of real-world scenes. The limits include the inability to handle complex latent structures and the lack of active sampling strategies to maximize evidence for the agent's internal generative model.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project will apply active inference principles to simulate the agent's decisions, allowing it to develop probabilistic beliefs about the environment and actively sample it to maximize the evidence for its internal model. This approach leverages the free energy principle and hierarchical scene construction models, which are more robust and adaptable to complex environments[5].\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nSuccess in this project will demonstrate the feasibility of using active inference in visual foraging tasks, providing insights into how agents can efficiently gather information in uncertain environments. This can have implications for fields such as robotics, computer vision, and cognitive neuroscience.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\nThe main risks include the complexity of implementing hierarchical models and the potential for high computational demands. There is also a risk that the agent may not perform as expected due to the inherent uncertainty in the task.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThis project will require minimal costs, primarily related to computational resources and potentially some software licenses. The main resource will be time and effort.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\nThis project is expected to take approximately 1-2 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the implementation and the availability of computational resources.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Initial Check Point (Week 1):** Set up the basic environment and implement a simple generative model.\n- **Mid-term Check Point (Week 4):** Implement the active inference algorithm and test it on a simplified scene.\n- **Final Check Point (Week 8):** Evaluate the performance of the agent in a more complex hierarchical scene and document the results.\n\n**Collaboration and Resources:**\n- Collaborate with other interns at the Active Inference Institute.\n- Utilize the RxInfer package and other software tools mentioned in relevant papers.\n- Engage in the institute's community activities and seek mentorship from experienced researchers.\n\n### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Developing Robust Software Tools for Active Inference\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nDevelop and improve software tools, specifically enhancing the RxInfer package, to address the computational challenges in active inference such as scaling, real-time inference, and working with composable/hierarchical models.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrent software tools for active inference, such as the RxInfer package, are limited by their scalability and real-time performance. They often do not support composable or hierarchical models efficiently, which hampers their application in complex problem domains.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project will involve integrating advanced techniques such as deep neural networks and hybrid active inference models to enhance the scalability and real-time performance of the software tools. It will also focus on developing better support for composable and hierarchical models, leveraging the free energy principle and recent advancements in the field[1][4].\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nSuccess in this project will significantly benefit the entire active inference community by providing more robust and efficient software tools. This will facilitate wider adoption and more complex applications of active inference principles across various disciplines.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\nThe main risks include the technical challenges of integrating new techniques, potential compatibility issues with existing code, and the need for extensive testing to ensure robustness.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThe costs will primarily be related to computational resources and potentially some software licenses. There may also be a need for additional funding to support collaboration with other researchers or developers.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\nThis project is expected to take approximately 3-6 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the enhancements and the availability of resources.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Initial Check Point (Month 1):** Identify key areas for improvement in the current software tools and develop a detailed plan.\n- **Mid-term Check Point (Month 3):** Implement and test the initial set of enhancements.\n- **Final Check Point (Month 6):** Complete the enhancements, conduct thorough testing, and document the results.\n\n**Collaboration and Resources:**\n- Collaborate with other developers and researchers at the Active Inference Institute.\n- Utilize the institute's educational materials, academic papers, and community resources.\n- Engage in project reporting sessions and seek feedback from the community.\n\n### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Applying Active Inference to Complex Maze Navigation\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nDevelop an active inference agent capable of navigating a complex, mutating maze by applying hierarchical and composable models to handle the dynamic environment and uncertainty.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrently, maze navigation tasks are often approached using simpler models such as reinforcement learning or traditional pathfinding algorithms. These methods do not efficiently handle the complexity and dynamic nature of mutating mazes.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project will apply active inference principles to develop an agent that can adaptively learn and navigate a mutating maze. The agent will use hierarchical models to infer the latent structure of the maze and actively sample the environment to maximize the evidence for its internal generative model. This approach leverages the free energy principle and advanced decision-making schemes such as predictive planning and counterfactual learning[3][5].\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nSuccess in this project will demonstrate the power of active inference in handling complex, dynamic environments, which can have significant implications for robotics, autonomous systems, and cognitive neuroscience.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\nThe main risks include the high complexity of implementing hierarchical models in a dynamic environment, the potential for high computational demands, and the challenge of ensuring the agent's adaptability to changing maze configurations.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThe costs will be significant, involving substantial computational resources, potential software licenses, and possibly additional funding to support collaboration with other researchers or developers.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\nThis project is expected to take approximately 6-12 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the implementation and the availability of resources.\n\n#### 8.
