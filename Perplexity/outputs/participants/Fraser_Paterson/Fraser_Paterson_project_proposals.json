What are you trying to do?\nDevelop and test an Active Inference agent in a simple visual foraging task to understand how the agent accumulates evidence and makes decisions in a hierarchical scene construction scenario.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrently, active inference agents are simulated in various environments, but these simulations often lack real-time interaction and robustness in handling uncertainty. The current practice involves setting up simulations using existing frameworks like RxInfer, but these may not fully capture the complexities of real-world visual foraging tasks.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project will focus on creating a real-time interactive simulation of an active inference agent in a visual foraging task. The new approach involves integrating the RxInfer package with a real-time visualization tool to allow for dynamic interaction and feedback.

What are the risks?\nThe primary risks include the technical challenges of integrating the RxInfer package with real-time visualization tools and ensuring the simulation runs smoothly without significant computational overhead. There is also a risk that the simulation may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios, which could limit its usefulness.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThe project will primarily rely on existing resources and software tools available through the Active Inference Institute. Therefore, the costs will be minimal, mainly involving time and effort.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\nThis project is expected to take 1-2 months to complete, given the focused scope and the use of existing tools and frameworks.\n\n#### 8.
