### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Active Inference in Visual Foraging Tasks

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and test an Active Inference agent in a simple visual foraging task to understand how the agent accumulates evidence and makes decisions in a hierarchical scene construction scenario.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, active inference agents are simulated in various environments, but these simulations often lack real-time interaction and robustness in handling uncertainty. The current practice involves setting up simulations using existing frameworks like RxInfer, but these may not fully capture the complexities of real-world visual foraging tasks.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will focus on creating a real-time interactive simulation of an active inference agent in a visual foraging task. The new approach involves integrating the RxInfer package with a real-time visualization tool to allow for dynamic interaction and feedback. This will enable a more realistic simulation of how agents gather and process visual information, which is expected to be successful due to the direct application of active inference principles to a well-defined task.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will provide a tangible demonstration of active inference in action, which can be used for educational purposes and to engage new researchers in the field. It will also contribute to the development of more robust and interactive simulation tools, enhancing the community’s ability to test and refine active inference models.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risks include the technical challenges of integrating the RxInfer package with real-time visualization tools and ensuring the simulation runs smoothly without significant computational overhead. There is also a risk that the simulation may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios, which could limit its usefulness.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project will primarily rely on existing resources and software tools available through the Active Inference Institute. Therefore, the costs will be minimal, mainly involving time and effort.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take 1-2 months to complete, given the focused scope and the use of existing tools and frameworks.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point:** After one month, evaluate the integration of the RxInfer package with the visualization tool and ensure that the basic simulation is functional.
- **Final Check Point:** After two months, test the simulation in various visual foraging scenarios and evaluate its performance and robustness.

**Potential Collaborators/Resources:**
- Collaborate with other researchers at the Active Inference Institute who have experience with real-time simulations.
- Utilize the Institute’s textbook groups, livestreams, and courses for additional guidance.
- Engage with the community through the Discord channel for feedback and support.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Scaling Active Inference Models Using Deep Neural Networks

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a method to scale active inference models using deep neural networks to handle complex and large-scale environments, addressing the computational challenges of current active inference implementations.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, active inference models are often limited by their computational efficiency and scalability. The use of deep neural networks is not widespread in active inference, and current implementations struggle with real-time inference in complex environments. The limits include high computational costs and the inability to handle large-scale data efficiently.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will explore the integration of deep neural networks into active inference models to improve scalability and computational efficiency. The new approach involves using deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) to learn generative state space models, which is expected to be successful due to the proven capabilities of deep neural networks in handling large-scale data and complex tasks.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will significantly impact the field by enabling active inference models to be applied to more complex and real-world scenarios, such as autonomous navigation and decision-making in uncertain environments. This will make active inference more viable for practical applications.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risks include the technical challenges of integrating deep neural networks with active inference frameworks, ensuring that the models remain interpretable, and managing the increased computational requirements.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project will require access to computational resources (e.g., GPUs) and potentially some software licenses, but these costs can be managed within the resources of the Active Inference Institute.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take 3-6 months to complete, given the need to develop and test the integration of deep neural networks with active inference models.

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Hierarchical Active Inference for Compositional Latent Structure

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a hierarchical active inference framework capable of inferring compositional latent structure in complex environments, such as visual scene construction and sentence comprehension, and apply it to real-world problems like autonomous navigation and decision-making.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, active inference models are applied in various hierarchical scenarios but often lack the ability to robustly infer compositional latent structure. The limits include the difficulty in scaling these models to complex environments and the lack of robust methods for handling uncertainty and ambiguity.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will focus on developing advanced hierarchical inference methods within the active inference framework, leveraging recent advances in generative models and deep neural networks. The new approach involves using a combination of Bayesian inference and variational inference to handle the complexities of compositional latent structure, which is expected to be successful due to the theoretical foundations of active inference and the power of hierarchical models.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will revolutionize the field by enabling active inference to be applied to highly complex and dynamic environments. This will have significant impacts on various fields such as robotics, cognitive neuroscience, and artificial intelligence, making active inference a central framework for understanding and modeling adaptive behavior.
