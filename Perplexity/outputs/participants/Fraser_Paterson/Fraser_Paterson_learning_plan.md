### Immediate Next Steps (1-2 weeks)

#### Specific Resources to Start With:
- **Active Inference Institute Materials**:
  - Start with the educational materials, such as videos, livestreams, and courses available on the Active Inference Institute's website. This will help reinforce the foundational concepts of Active Inference[2].
- **Key Academic Papers**:
  - Read the paper "Learning Generative State Space Models for Active Inference" to understand how active inference can be scaled using deep neural networks and the role of free energy minimization[1].
  - Review the paper "Deep Active Inference and Scene Construction" to grasp how active inference is applied in hierarchical scene construction and the principles of evidence accumulation[2].

#### Initial Learning Objectives:
- Understand the basic principles of active inference, including the free energy principle and its application in perception and action.
- Familiarize yourself with the concept of generative models and how they are used in active inference.

#### Concrete Actions to Take:
- **Join Institute's Community Activities**:
  - Participate in the Active Inference Institute's Discord meetings and project reporting sessions to engage with the community and gain insights from other participants.
- **Contribute to RxInfer Package**:
  - Continue contributing to the RxInfer package, focusing on addressing the computational challenges you've identified.
- **Set Up a Personal Project**:
  - Start a small personal project that applies active inference to a simple scenario, such as a visual foraging task, to practice implementing the concepts learned.

### Short-Term Goals (1-3 months)

#### Key Concepts to Master:
- **Free Energy Principle**:
  - Delve deeper into the free energy principle and its mathematical formulation. Understand how it relates to perception, action, and learning[1][2][5].
- **Generative Models**:
  - Learn about the types of generative models used in active inference, including hierarchical models and their application in complex environments[2][4].
- **Decision-Making Schemes**:
  - Study the different decision-making schemes in active inference, such as the DPEFE scheme and the counterfactual learning method[3].

#### Practical Exercises or Projects:
- **Implement a Simple Active Inference Agent**:
  - Using the knowledge gained, implement a simple active inference agent in a controlled environment (e.g., a grid world) to practice the concepts.
- **Visual Foraging Task**:
  - Apply active inference to a visual foraging task, simulating how an agent categorizes a scene in a hierarchical context[2].

#### Recommended Study Materials:
- **Textbook Groups**:
  - Join the textbook groups at the Active Inference Institute to engage in structured learning and discussion with peers.
- **Tutorials and Workshops**:
  - Participate in any available tutorials or workshops hosted by the institute or other relevant organizations.
