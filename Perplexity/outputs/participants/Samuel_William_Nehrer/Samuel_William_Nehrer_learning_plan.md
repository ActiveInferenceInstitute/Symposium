### Detailed Learning Plan for Samuel William Nehrer on Active Inference

#### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Introduction to Active Inference:**
  - Start with Karl Friston's introductory lectures on Active Inference available on YouTube or other academic platforms. For example, his lecture series at the University of Cambridge can provide a comprehensive introduction[2].
  - Read the introductory chapter of Friston's book or articles that outline the basics of Active Inference, such as "The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory?" by Karl Friston.

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the fundamental principles of Active Inference.
- Learn how Active Inference integrates Bayesian inference and control theory.
- Familiarize yourself with key terms and concepts.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Watch at least 2-3 introductory lectures by Karl Friston or other prominent researchers in the field.
- Read and summarize the key points from the introductory chapter or article.
- Join online forums or discussion groups related to Active Inference (e.g., ResearchGate, Reddit) to engage with the community.

#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Bayesian Inference:** Understand the basics of Bayesian inference and how it is applied in Active Inference.
- **Free-Energy Principle:** Learn about the free-energy principle and its role in Active Inference.
- **Perception and Action:** Study how Active Inference models perception and action.

**Practical Exercises or Projects:**
- **Simulation Exercises:** Use software tools like MATLAB or Python to simulate simple Active Inference models. For example, use the `spm` package in MATLAB, which is developed by Karl Friston's group.
- **Case Studies:** Analyze and replicate simple case studies or examples from research papers to understand the practical application of Active Inference.

**Recommended Study Materials:**
- **Textbooks and Articles:**
  - "The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory?" by Karl Friston.
  - "Active Inference: A Process Theory" by Friston et al..
  - Online tutorials and workshops, such as those available on the 5th International Workshop on Active Inference website[2].
- **Online Courses:**
  - Look for online courses or MOOCs that cover Active Inference, such as those on Coursera or edX.

**Community Engagement Opportunities:**
- Participate in online forums and discussion groups related to Active Inference.
- Join the 5th International Workshop on Active Inference or similar events to network with researchers in the field[2].

#### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)
