### Personalized Learning Plan for Samuel William Nehrer on Active Inference

#### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Introduction to Active Inference:**
  - Start with the introductory materials from the 5th International Workshop on Active Inference, such as the overview and key concepts presented in the workshop program[4].
  - Watch introductory lectures or talks available on YouTube or academic platforms, such as those by Prof. Karl Friston, a pioneer in the field of Active Inference.

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the basic principles of Active Inference.
- Familiarize yourself with the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and its role in Active Inference.
- Learn the key differences between Active Inference and other cognitive modeling frameworks.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Read the introductory sections of recent research papers on Active Inference, such as those presented at the 5th International Workshop on Active Inference[4].
- Join online forums or discussion groups focused on Active Inference, such as the Active Inference subreddit or relevant LinkedIn groups.
- Set up a personal project to implement a simple Active Inference model using software tools like MATLAB or Python libraries such as `spm` (Statistical Parametric Mapping) or `pyfr` (Python Framework for Active Inference).

#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Free Energy Principle (FEP):** Understand how FEP is applied in Active Inference to explain perception, action, and learning.
- **Generative Models:** Learn about the role of generative models in Active Inference and how they are used to predict sensory inputs.
- **Bayesian Inference:** Study the Bayesian inference methods used in Active Inference to update beliefs based on sensory evidence.

**Practical Exercises or Projects:**
- **Implement a Simple Active Inference Model:** Use MATLAB or Python to implement a basic Active Inference model for a simple task, such as a one-dimensional tracking problem.
- **Analyze Case Studies:** Read and analyze case studies or research papers that apply Active Inference to various domains, such as psychiatry or neuroimaging.

**Recommended Study Materials:**
- **Books:**
  - "The Free-Energy Principle: A Unified Brain Theory?" by Karl Friston (available as a preprint or through academic databases).
  - Relevant chapters from "Principles of Neural Science" that discuss Bayesian inference and generative models[2].
- **Academic Papers:**
  - Papers from the 5th International Workshop on Active Inference, such as "Modeling Sustainability under Active Inference through resource management" or "Contextuality, Cognitive engagement, and Active Inference"[4].
- **Online Courses:**
  - Look for online courses or lectures on cognitive modeling and Bayesian inference, such as those offered on Coursera or edX.

**Community Engagement Opportunities:**
- **Attend Webinars or Seminars:** Participate in webinars or online seminars related to Active Inference, such as those hosted by the University of Cambridge or other neuroscience departments.
- **Join Research Groups:** Reach out to research groups at Aarhus University or other institutions that are actively working on Active Inference projects to explore potential collaboration opportunities.

#### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)

**Advanced Topics to Explore:**
- **Active Inference in Psychiatry:** Delve into how Active Inference is applied in psychiatric research, such as modeling agency perception in depression[4].
- **Neuroimaging and Active Inference:** Study how Active Inference is integrated with neuroimaging techniques to understand brain function and behavior.
- **Multi-Agent Active Inference:** Learn about the application of Active Inference in multi-agent systems and its implications for social cognition.

**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**
- **Research Projects:** Collaborate with researchers at Aarhus University or other institutions on projects that apply Active Inference to cognitive science and psychiatry.
- **Workshop Participation:** Attend the 5th International Workshop on Active Inference or similar events to network with other researchers and present your work[4].

**Application Projects in Their Domain:**
- **Modeling Cognitive Processes:** Use Active Inference to model specific cognitive processes relevant to your research interests, such as decision-making or sensory perception.
- **Clinical Applications:** Explore how Active Inference can be applied in clinical settings, particularly in psychiatry, to better understand and predict patient behavior.

**Skill-Building Activities:**
- **Programming Skills:** Enhance your programming skills in MATLAB or Python, focusing on libraries and tools relevant to Active Inference.
- **Data Analysis:** Learn advanced data analysis techniques, including Bayesian inference and machine learning methods, to analyze data from Active Inference models.
