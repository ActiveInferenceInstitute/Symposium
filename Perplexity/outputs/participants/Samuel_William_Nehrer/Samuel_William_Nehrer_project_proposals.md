### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Simulating Active Inference Models for Simple Perceptual Tasks

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
You aim to simulate simple Active Inference models to understand how they handle basic perceptual tasks, such as recognizing visual patterns or predicting sensory inputs.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, researchers use software tools like MATLAB or Python to simulate Active Inference models. However, for newcomers, setting up these simulations can be daunting due to the complexity of the models and the need for a strong understanding of Bayesian inference and control theory. The limits include the steep learning curve and the lack of straightforward tutorials for beginners.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
Your approach involves creating a step-by-step guide and tutorial for simulating simple Active Inference models using MATLAB or Python. You will use existing resources from Karl Friston's group and the `spm` package in MATLAB to create a user-friendly workflow. This will include pre-written code snippets, detailed explanations, and example datasets to help beginners replicate the simulations.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will make it easier for new researchers, including students like Samuel William Nehrer, to get started with Active Inference. By providing a clear and accessible guide, you will lower the barrier to entry, enabling more people to explore and apply Active Inference in their research.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risk is that the tutorial might not be comprehensive enough or might not be well-received by the community. Additionally, there is a risk that the simulations might not accurately reflect real-world scenarios.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project is expected to be low-cost since it primarily involves using existing software tools and resources. Any costs would be related to potentially hiring a tutor or collaborator for a short period.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project should take approximately 1-2 months to complete, depending on the depth of the tutorial and the complexity of the simulations.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point:** After one month, review the progress on the tutorial and simulations. Ensure that the code snippets are working correctly and the explanations are clear.
- **Final Check Point:** After two months, finalize the tutorial and publish it on platforms like ResearchGate or GitHub. Gather feedback from the community to assess its usefulness and make necessary adjustments.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Applying Active Inference to Model Psychiatric Disorders

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
You aim to apply Active Inference to model specific psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia or depression, to better understand the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, researchers use various computational models to study psychiatric disorders, but these models often lack the integrative power of Active Inference. The limits include the complexity of integrating multiple levels of cognitive and neural processes and the need for large datasets to validate the models.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
Your approach involves using Active Inference to integrate Bayesian inference and control theory to model the perceptual, cognitive, and motor aspects of psychiatric disorders. You will collaborate with researchers in psychiatry to gather clinical data and use software tools like MATLAB or Python to implement the models. The novelty lies in applying Active Inference to provide a more unified and mechanistic understanding of these disorders.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders, potentially leading to better diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies. It will also contribute to the broader understanding of how Active Inference can be applied in clinical settings.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of the models, the need for high-quality clinical data, and the potential for the models to not accurately capture the clinical phenomena.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project may require funding for data collection, collaboration with clinical researchers, and potentially hiring a research assistant. The costs could range from a few thousand to tens of thousands of dollars, depending on the scope.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take around 6-9 months to complete, including data collection, model development, and validation.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point:** After three months, review the progress on data collection and initial model development. Ensure that the data quality is good and the models are running correctly.
- **Final Check Point:** After six months, finalize the models and conduct initial validation using the collected data. Publish preliminary findings in a research paper or present at a conference to gather feedback.

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing an Active Inference Framework for Emergent Group-Level Behaviors

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
You aim to develop an Active Inference framework that can model and predict emergent behaviors at the group level, such as social interactions or collective decision-making.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, researchers use various models to study group behaviors, but these models often fail to capture the complex interactions and emergent properties seen in real-world groups. The limits include the lack of a unified theoretical framework that can integrate individual and group-level processes.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
Your approach involves extending Active Inference to the group level by integrating individual generative models into a larger framework that can capture emergent behaviors. You will use advanced mathematical techniques such as variational inference and predictive coding to model the interactions between individuals and the group. The novelty lies in applying Active Inference to understand complex social phenomena.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will provide a groundbreaking framework for understanding and predicting group behaviors, which could have significant implications for fields such as social psychology, sociology, and economics. It could also lead to new strategies for managing group dynamics and improving collective decision-making.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the high complexity of the models, the need for significant computational resources, and the potential difficulty in validating the models against real-world data.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project could require substantial funding for computational resources, data collection, and potentially hiring a team of researchers. The costs could range from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take around 1-2 years to complete, including the development of the theoretical framework, implementation of the models, and validation using real-world data.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point:** After six months, review the progress on the theoretical framework and initial model development. Ensure that the mathematical formulations are sound and the models are running correctly.
- **Final Check Point:** After one year, finalize the models and conduct extensive validation using real-world data. Publish the findings in a high-impact research paper or present at a major conference to gather feedback and validate the approach.

Each of these proposals is tailored to Samuel William Nehrer's background and interests, with increasing complexity and scope as he progresses in his learning and application of Active Inference.
