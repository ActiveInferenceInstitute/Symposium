### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Implementing a Basic Active Inference Model

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Implement a simple Active Inference model to understand and predict basic sensory-motor behaviors, such as a one-dimensional tracking task.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, Active Inference models are often implemented using advanced computational tools and complex mathematical frameworks. However, for a beginner, the process can be daunting due to the steep learning curve and the need for significant computational resources. The limits include the complexity of the models, the requirement for extensive programming skills, and the lack of straightforward tutorials for newcomers.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will use simplified tutorials and existing software frameworks (e.g., `spm` or `pyfr`) to implement a basic Active Inference model. The approach will be successful because it leverages readily available resources and step-by-step guides, making it more accessible for someone new to the field. The project will also include a detailed documentation process to help others follow the same steps.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will provide a clear, reproducible example of how to implement an Active Inference model, which can serve as a teaching tool for other students and researchers. It will also help Samuel William Nehrer gain hands-on experience with Active Inference, enhancing his understanding and skills in computational modeling.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the potential for errors in implementation due to lack of experience and the possibility that the model may not perform as expected. However, these risks can be mitigated by closely following established tutorials and seeking feedback from more experienced researchers.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will not incur significant costs as it will utilize free or open-source software tools and existing computational resources available at Aarhus University.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take approximately 1-2 weeks to complete, depending on the depth of the implementation and the amount of time dedicated to it each week.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point:** After one week, review the progress on implementing the basic model and ensure that the key components (generative model, free energy minimization) are correctly set up.
- **Final Check Point:** After two weeks, test the model on a simple task and evaluate its performance. Document the process and results, and share them with peers or mentors for feedback.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Applying Active Inference to Psychiatric Research

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Apply Active Inference to model agency perception in psychiatric conditions such as depression, and explore how this framework can provide insights into patient behavior and treatment outcomes.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, psychiatric research often uses traditional cognitive models that do not fully capture the complexities of perception and action. Active Inference offers a more integrated framework but requires advanced computational skills and access to relevant datasets. The limits include the complexity of integrating Active Inference with clinical data and the need for interdisciplinary collaboration.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will leverage existing research papers and case studies on Active Inference in psychiatry, and utilize computational tools to model agency perception. The approach will be successful because it combines theoretical understanding with practical application, using real-world clinical data to validate the models. Collaboration with psychiatric researchers at Aarhus University will provide valuable insights and ensure the models are clinically relevant.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will contribute to a better understanding of psychiatric conditions through the lens of Active Inference, potentially leading to more personalized and effective treatment strategies. It will also demonstrate the utility of Active Inference in a clinical context, which could inspire further research and applications.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The risks include the complexity of working with clinical data, potential ethical issues, and the challenge of ensuring that the models accurately reflect real-world patient behaviors. Mitigation strategies include careful data handling, ethical approvals, and close collaboration with clinical experts.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project may require access to specialized software or datasets, but these costs are expected to be minimal. The primary resource will be time and computational power available at the university.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 3-6 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the models and the availability of clinical data.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point:** After 2 months, review the progress on model development and data integration. Ensure that the generative models are correctly specified and that the free energy minimization process is functioning as expected.
- **Final Check Point:** After 6 months, evaluate the performance of the models using clinical data and compare the results with existing cognitive models. Present the findings in a research paper or at a relevant conference.

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing a Multi-Agent Active Inference Framework for Social Cognition

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a multi-agent Active Inference framework to model and understand social cognition and interaction, including how individuals infer and influence each other's beliefs and actions.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, social cognition is often studied using simpler models that do not fully capture the dynamic and reciprocal nature of social interactions. Active Inference can provide a more comprehensive framework, but extending it to multi-agent systems is a complex task that requires significant theoretical and computational advancements. The limits include the need for advanced mathematical formulations and the integration of multiple agents' perspectives.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will build on recent advances in multi-agent systems and Active Inference, incorporating new mathematical formulations and computational methods to model social cognition. The approach will be successful because it will integrate insights from social psychology, neuroscience, and computational modeling, providing a holistic understanding of social interactions. Collaboration with researchers from various disciplines will ensure the framework is robust and applicable.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will revolutionize the understanding of social cognition by providing a powerful framework for modeling and predicting social interactions. It will have significant implications for fields such as psychology, neuroscience, sociology, and even artificial intelligence, enabling better design of social robots and more effective social interventions.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The risks include the high complexity of the project, the need for significant computational resources, and the potential for ethical issues when modeling human social behavior. Mitigation strategies include breaking down the project into manageable components, collaborating with experts from multiple fields, and ensuring ethical approvals and data handling practices.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project may require substantial resources, including access to high-performance computing, specialized software, and potentially funding for research assistants or collaborators. However, the costs can be managed through grants and collaborative funding opportunities.

#### 7. How long will it take?
