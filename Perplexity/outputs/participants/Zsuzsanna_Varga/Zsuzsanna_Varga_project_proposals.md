### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Simulating Basic Active Inference Models in Healthcare

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create and simulate basic Active Inference models to understand how they can be applied in simple healthcare scenarios, such as patient monitoring or basic decision support.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, healthcare professionals rely on traditional statistical methods and simple machine learning models for patient monitoring and decision support. However, these methods often lack the dynamic and adaptive capabilities that Active Inference can offer. The limits include the lack of real-time adaptation and the inability to handle complex, dynamic systems.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project introduces the use of Active Inference models, which are based on the free energy principle and Bayesian inference. These models can adapt in real-time and handle complex, dynamic systems, making them more suitable for healthcare applications. Success is anticipated because Active Inference has shown promise in other fields by providing more robust and adaptive modeling.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Healthcare professionals, patients, and healthcare institutions will benefit from this project. By developing and simulating basic Active Inference models, it will be possible to create more adaptive and responsive patient monitoring and decision support systems, potentially improving patient outcomes and streamlining healthcare processes.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of Active Inference models, which might be challenging to implement for someone new to the field, and the potential for errors in simulation that could misrepresent the model's capabilities.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will primarily require access to software tools like MATLAB or Python and the Active Inference Toolbox, which are relatively low-cost or open-source. There may also be a need for online courses or workshops, but these can be found at a reasonable cost.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take about 1-3 months to complete, depending on the depth of the simulations and the complexity of the models.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point:** After 1 month, review the progress on simulating basic models and assess the understanding of key Active Inference concepts.
- **Final Check Point:** After 3 months, complete a small project that applies Active Inference to a healthcare scenario and present it for feedback.

**Technical Details and Methodologies:**
- Use the Active Inference Toolbox for simulations.
- Employ MATLAB or Python for model creation.
- Follow tutorials and workshops provided by the Active Inference Institute.

**Potential Collaborators or Resources:**
- Active Inference Institute resources and community.
- Online forums like the Active Inference Forum.
- Academic papers on Active Inference applications in healthcare.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Developing a Clinical Decision Support System Using Active Inference

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a clinical decision support system (CDSS) that leverages Active Inference principles to help healthcare professionals make more informed and adaptive decisions in oncology care.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, CDSSs in oncology often rely on static algorithms and do not adapt to the dynamic nature of patient data. These systems lack the real-time adaptability and learning capabilities that Active Inference can provide.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project integrates Active Inference into CDSSs, enabling real-time adaptation to patient data and dynamic learning. This approach is expected to be successful because Active Inference has shown potential in handling complex, dynamic systems, which is crucial in oncology care.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Healthcare professionals, patients, and healthcare institutions will benefit. A CDSS based on Active Inference can improve decision-making, enhance patient outcomes, and streamline clinical workflows.

#### 5. What are the risks?
Risks include the complexity of integrating Active Inference with existing healthcare systems, potential biases in the models, and ethical considerations related to AI in healthcare.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require more significant resources, including access to advanced software tools, potential collaborations with AI researchers, and possibly some funding for data collection and testing. Estimated costs could range from a few thousand to tens of thousands of dollars, depending on the scope.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take about 6-12 months to complete, considering the need for data collection, model development, and testing.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point:** After 3 months, evaluate the progress on model development and data integration.
- **Final Check Point:** After 12 months, complete the CDSS and conduct a pilot study to assess its effectiveness.

**Technical Details and Methodologies:**
- Use Python or MATLAB for model creation and integration with healthcare systems.
- Employ the Active Inference Toolbox and other relevant libraries.
- Collaborate with AI researchers and healthcare professionals to ensure clinical relevance.
- Conduct thorough testing and validation of the CDSS.

**Potential Collaborators or Resources:**
- Interdisciplinary teams including AI researchers, engineers, and healthcare professionals.
- Access to healthcare data and clinical settings for testing.
- Resources from the Active Inference Institute and online forums.

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Integrating Deep Learning with Active Inference for Advanced Healthcare Applications

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop an advanced healthcare system that integrates deep learning techniques with Active Inference to create highly adaptive and intelligent models for patient monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment planning in oncology.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, healthcare systems often use either deep learning or Active Inference separately, but not in combination. This limits the adaptability and learning capabilities of the models, especially in complex and dynamic healthcare scenarios.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project combines the strengths of deep learning (high-dimensional data handling) with the adaptive and learning capabilities of Active Inference. This integrated approach is expected to be successful because it leverages the best of both worlds, providing robust, adaptive, and highly accurate models for healthcare applications.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will significantly impact healthcare professionals, patients, and healthcare institutions by providing advanced, adaptive models that can improve patient outcomes, streamline clinical workflows, and enhance decision-making.

#### 5. What are the risks?
Risks include the complexity of integrating deep learning with Active Inference, potential ethical issues related to AI in healthcare, and the need for large datasets for training and validation.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require significant resources, including advanced software tools, access to large datasets, and potential collaborations with AI researchers and engineers. Estimated costs could range from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take about 1-2 years to complete, considering the complexity of the integration, data collection, and thorough testing.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
