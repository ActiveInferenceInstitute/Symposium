### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Active Inference in Agricultural Decision-Making

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a simple Active Inference model to simulate farmer decision-making in traditional agro-ecosystems, focusing on how farmers adapt to environmental changes.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, agricultural decision-making models often rely on static or linear assumptions, neglecting the dynamic and adaptive nature of farmer behavior. These models lack the sophistication to capture the complex interactions between farmers' perceptions, actions, and environmental feedback.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project introduces Active Inference, which integrates Bayesian inference and free energy minimization to model dynamic decision-making processes. By using generative models, the project will simulate how farmers update their beliefs and take actions based on changing environmental conditions. This approach is new because it incorporates the adaptive and perceptual aspects of decision-making, which are crucial in socio-ecological systems.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will provide insights into the adaptive behaviors of farmers, helping to predict and manage agricultural diversity more effectively. It will also contribute to the development of more resilient agricultural systems by understanding how farmers respond to environmental uncertainties.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Methodological Challenges:** Adapting Active Inference to agricultural contexts might require significant methodological adjustments.
- **Data Availability:** Access to detailed data on farmer decision-making and environmental conditions could be limited.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project is expected to be low-cost, primarily requiring computational resources and access to existing datasets or literature.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- **Initial Simulation Development:** 2-3 months
- **Data Integration and Testing:** 1-2 months
- **Total Duration:** 3-5 months

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Month 1:** Complete a basic simulation framework using MATLAB or Python.
- **Month 2:** Integrate initial data and run preliminary simulations.
- **Month 3-5:** Refine the model based on feedback, test with real-world data, and prepare a final report.

**Resources and Collaborators:**
- Utilize MATLAB scripts or Python implementations available on the SPM website or GitHub.
- Collaborate with researchers from the Fenner School of Environment and Society who have expertise in agricultural systems and decision-making models.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Active Inference in Forest Restoration Governance

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop an Active Inference model to analyze the decision-making processes of stakeholders involved in forest and landscape restoration governance, focusing on how perceptions and actions influence restoration outcomes.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current models of forest restoration governance often use static or simplistic decision-making frameworks, failing to account for the dynamic interactions between stakeholders' perceptions, actions, and environmental feedback. These models do not fully capture the complexity of stakeholder decision-making.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project applies Active Inference to model the dynamic and adaptive decision-making processes of stakeholders. By using free energy minimization and generative models, the project will simulate how stakeholders update their beliefs and take actions based on changing environmental and social conditions. This approach is innovative because it integrates perceptual and action components, providing a more comprehensive understanding of governance processes.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success will provide insights into the decision-making dynamics of stakeholders, helping to improve the effectiveness and resilience of forest restoration efforts. It will also contribute to the development of more adaptive governance models that can respond to changing environmental and social conditions.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Complexity of Stakeholder Interactions:** Modeling the complex interactions between multiple stakeholders could be challenging.
- **Data Collection:** Gathering detailed data on stakeholder perceptions and actions might be difficult.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require moderate resources, including computational tools, potential travel for data collection, and collaboration costs.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- **Literature Review and Model Development:** 3-4 months
- **Data Collection and Integration:** 2-3 months
- **Model Testing and Refinement:** 2-3 months
- **Total Duration:** 7-10 months

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Month 3:** Complete the initial model framework and literature review.
- **Month 6:** Collect and integrate data into the model.
- **Month 9-10:** Test and refine the model, prepare a final report.

**Resources and Collaborators:**
- Utilize resources from the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging and SPM software.
- Collaborate with researchers from the Fenner School of Environment and Society and other institutions specializing in forest governance and Active Inference.

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Integrating Active Inference into Socio-Ecological System Models for Resilience Analysis

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a comprehensive Active Inference framework to analyze and predict the resilience of socio-ecological systems, integrating it into existing models of agricultural, forestry, and water systems.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current resilience models in socio-ecological systems often lack a clear mechanism to capture the adaptive and perceptual aspects of human decision-making. These models are usually static or based on simplistic assumptions about human behavior, failing to fully account for the dynamic interactions between human actions and environmental feedback.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project integrates Active Inference into existing socio-ecological system models to provide a more comprehensive and dynamic framework for resilience analysis. By using Bayesian inference and free energy minimization, the project will simulate how human perceptions and actions adapt to changing environmental conditions, enhancing the predictive power of resilience models. This approach is innovative because it combines the strengths of socio-ecological modeling with the adaptive and perceptual insights of Active Inference.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success will significantly enhance the ability to predict and manage the resilience of socio-ecological systems, contributing to more sustainable and adaptive management practices in agriculture, forestry, and water management. It will also advance the field of complex systems modeling by integrating Active Inference into mainstream socio-ecological research.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Integration Complexity:** Integrating Active Inference into existing complex models could be highly challenging.
- **Data and Computational Requirements:** The project may require extensive datasets and significant computational resources.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require substantial resources, including advanced computational tools, potential travel for data collection, collaboration costs, and possibly funding for research assistants.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- **Literature Review and Initial Model Development:** 4-6 months
- **Data Collection and Integration:** 4-6 months
- **Model Testing and Refinement:** 6-8 months
