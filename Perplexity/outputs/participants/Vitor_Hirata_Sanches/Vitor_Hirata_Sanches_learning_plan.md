### Personalized Learning Plan for Vitor Hirata Sanches: Integrating Active Inference into Socio-Ecological Systems Research

#### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Introduction to Active Inference:**
  - Start with the foundational paper by Karl Friston on Active Inference: "Active inference and free-energy" [available through various academic databases or the author's website].
  - Watch introductory videos or lectures on Active Inference, such as those by Karl Friston on YouTube or academic conference presentations.

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the basic principles of Active Inference, including Bayesian inference, free energy minimization, and the relationship between perception and action.
- Familiarize yourself with the key terminology and concepts.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Read the introductory paper by Karl Friston.
- Watch at least 2-3 introductory videos or lectures.
- Take notes on key concepts and terminology.
- Join online forums or discussion groups focused on Active Inference (e.g., Reddit’s r/Neuroscience or r/MachineLearning) to ask initial questions and get a feel for the community.

#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Bayesian Inference:** Understand how Bayesian inference is applied in Active Inference.
- **Free Energy Minimization:** Learn how free energy minimization drives decision-making and perception in Active Inference.
- **Generative Models:** Understand the role of generative models in Active Inference.

**Practical Exercises or Projects:**
- **Simple Simulations:** Use software like MATLAB or Python to simulate basic Active Inference models. For example, you can start with simple perceptual inference tasks.
  - Resource: MATLAB scripts for Active Inference available on the SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping) website or Python implementations on GitHub.

**Recommended Study Materials:**
- **Books:**
  - "The Free-Energy Principle: A Unified Brain Theory?" by Karl Friston[5].
  - "Active Inference: The Free-Energy Principle in Mind and Brain" (a more detailed textbook)[5].
- **Tutorials and Courses:**
  - Online courses on Active Inference, such as those offered through Coursera, edX, or the University of London’s UCL course on Active Inference.
  - Tutorials and workshops by the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging.

**Community Engagement Opportunities:**
- **Conferences and Workshops:** Look for upcoming conferences or workshops focused on Active Inference, such as those organized by the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging.
- **Research Groups:** Reach out to research groups at universities that are actively working on Active Inference, such as the University College London (UCL) or the University of California, San Diego.

#### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)

**Advanced Topics to Explore:**
- **Inductive Planning:** Study how Active Inference is used in inductive planning, particularly in complex decision-making scenarios.
  - Resource: The paper "Active Inference and Intentional Behaviour" on arXiv[5].
- **Resilience and Adaptive Systems:** Explore how Active Inference can be applied to understand resilience in socio-ecological systems.
  - Resource: The article "Resilience and active inference" from Frontiers in Psychology[4].

**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**
- **Interdisciplinary Teams:** Collaborate with researchers from neuroscience, ecology, and other relevant fields who are applying Active Inference.
  - Example: Reach out to researchers at the Fenner School of Environment and Society who might be interested in integrating Active Inference into socio-ecological models.

**Application Projects in Their Domain:**
- **Agricultural Diversity Modeling:** Apply Active Inference to model the emergence of varietal agricultural diversity in traditional agro-ecosystems.
  - Use generative models to simulate farmer decision-making processes and how they adapt to environmental changes.
- **Forest Restoration Governance:** Use Active Inference to analyze decision-making processes in forest and landscape restoration governance.
  - Model how stakeholders' perceptions and actions influence the outcomes of restoration efforts.

**Skill-Building Activities:**
- **Computational Skills:** Learn to use software tools like SPM, MATLAB, or Python libraries (e.g., PyTorch) to implement Active Inference models.
  - Resource: Tutorials on the SPM website or GitHub repositories for Active Inference implementations.
- **Modeling Complex Systems:** Attend workshops or online courses focused on modeling complex systems using Active Inference.
