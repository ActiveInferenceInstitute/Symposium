What are you trying to do?\nDevelop and simulate a simple Active Inference model to predict and optimize human decision-making in a basic water resource management scenario.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrently, water resource management often relies on traditional modeling approaches such as dynamic systems modeling or agent-based modeling, which may not fully capture the complexities of human decision-making. These models lack the integrated perspective of cognitive processes and environmental interactions that Active Inference provides.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project introduces Active Inference to model the decision-making process in water resource management. By using the free-energy principle, the model will incorporate both the cognitive and environmental aspects, allowing for a more holistic understanding of how humans manage water resources. This approach is new because it integrates Bayesian inference and control theory, which can better predict adaptive behavior under uncertainty.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nSuccess in this project will provide a novel framework for predicting and optimizing human decisions in water management, which could be crucial for policymakers and water resource managers. It will help in developing more resilient and adaptive management strategies, ultimately benefiting communities dependent on these resources.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\n- **Learning Curve**: The project relies on Vitor's rapid understanding of Active Inference, which could be challenging.\n- **Data Limitations**: Access to detailed data on human decision-making in water management might be limited.\n- **Interpretability**: The complexity of Active Inference models might make them difficult to interpret for non-experts.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThis project will primarily require computational resources and access to academic databases or software tools like MATLAB or Python, which are likely already available. There may be some costs associated with attending workshops or purchasing relevant books, but these are minimal.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\n- **Initial Understanding**: 1 week\n- **Model Development**: 2-3 weeks\n- **Simulation and Validation**: 2-3 weeks\n- **Total Duration**: Approximately 6-8 weeks\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Mid-term Checkpoint** (3 weeks): Successful simulation of a basic Active Inference model.\n- **Final Checkpoint** (6-8 weeks): Presentation of the results, including a report detailing the methodology and findings.\n\n**Resources and Collaborators:**\n- **Software Tools**: MATLAB or Python with relevant libraries.\n- **Academic Papers**: Foundational papers by Karl Friston and tutorials on the Active Inference Institute's website.\n- **Potential Collaborators**: Researchers at the University College London or other institutions known for their work in Active Inference.\n\n### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with Agent-Based Modeling in Agricultural Systems\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nDevelop an integrated model that combines Active Inference with agent-based modeling to predict farmer decision-making in traditional agricultural systems, incorporating factors like climate change and market dynamics.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrently, agricultural systems are often modeled using agent-based models that simulate farmer behavior but lack a detailed cognitive framework. These models do not fully account for the adaptive and intentional aspects of human decision-making.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project integrates Active Inference with agent-based modeling to provide a more comprehensive understanding of farmer decision-making. Active Inference will capture the cognitive processes and adaptive behavior, while agent-based modeling will simulate the interactions among farmers and their environment. This integrated approach is new and promising because it combines the strengths of both methodologies.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nSuccess in this project will provide policymakers and agricultural managers with a more accurate and predictive model of farmer behavior under various conditions. This can lead to better policy designs, more resilient agricultural practices, and improved adaptation to climate change.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\n- **Complexity**: Integrating two complex modeling frameworks can be challenging.\n- **Data Requirements**: Detailed data on farmer decision-making and environmental conditions may be difficult to obtain.\n- **Scalability**: The model may face scalability issues when applied to larger agricultural systems.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThis project will require significant computational resources, access to advanced software tools, and possibly some funding for data collection. However, the primary costs will be in time and computational resources.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\n- **Literature Review and Model Design**: 4-6 weeks\n- **Model Development and Integration**: 8-12 weeks\n- **Simulation and Validation**: 8-12 weeks\n- **Total Duration**: Approximately 20-30 weeks\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Mid-term Checkpoint** (12 weeks): Successful integration of Active Inference with agent-based modeling.\n- **Final Checkpoint** (20-30 weeks): Presentation of the results, including a detailed report and validation against real-world data.\n\n**Resources and Collaborators:**\n- **Software Tools**: MATLAB or Python with relevant libraries for both Active Inference and agent-based modeling.\n- **Academic Papers**: Papers on Active Inference by Karl Friston and literature on agent-based modeling in agricultural systems.\n- **Potential Collaborators**: Researchers at institutions specializing in agricultural systems modeling and Active Inference.\n\n### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing a Comprehensive Active Inference Framework for Resilience in Socio-Ecological Systems\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nDevelop a comprehensive Active Inference framework to model and predict human decision-making in socio-ecological systems, focusing on resilience in water management and agricultural systems. This framework will integrate complex systems modeling, Bayesian inference, and control theory to provide a holistic understanding of adaptive behavior.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrently, socio-ecological systems are modeled using a variety of approaches, but none fully capture the interplay between cognitive processes, environmental dynamics, and human decision-making. Existing models lack the integrated perspective that Active Inference offers.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project introduces a comprehensive Active Inference framework tailored to socio-ecological systems. It will incorporate advanced topics like partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and event-predictive learning to model complex decision-making scenarios. This approach is new and promising because it integrates multiple theoretical frameworks to provide a more complete understanding of resilience in these systems.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nSuccess in this project will revolutionize the way we model and predict human behavior in socio-ecological systems. It will provide policymakers, managers, and researchers with a powerful tool to develop resilient management strategies, ultimately benefiting the environment and communities dependent on these resources.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\n- **Theoretical and Computational Complexity**: Integrating multiple complex frameworks can be highly challenging.\n- **Data Requirements**: Access to detailed and diverse data sets may be difficult.\n- **Interpretability and Practicality**: The model may be complex to interpret and apply in real-world scenarios.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThis project will require significant computational resources, advanced software tools, and possibly funding for data collection and collaboration with other researchers. The costs will be substantial but justified by the potential impact.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\n- **Literature Review and Framework Design**: 12-16 weeks\n- **Model Development and Integration**: 20-24 weeks\n- **Simulation, Validation, and Iteration**: 24-30 weeks\n- **Total Duration**: Approximately 56-70 weeks (1-2 years)\n\n#### 8.
