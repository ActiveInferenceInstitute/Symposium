### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Active Inference in Cybersecurity Simulations

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create a simulation environment to demonstrate how Active Inference can enhance cybersecurity protocols by making AI systems more transparent and interpretable.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, cybersecurity simulations often rely on traditional reinforcement learning or rule-based systems, which may lack transparency and interpretability. These methods can be limited in their ability to handle complex, dynamic environments and may not fully account for epistemic uncertainty.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will integrate Active Inference principles into cybersecurity simulations using tools like RxInfer.jl. By leveraging the Bayesian framework and the Free Energy Principle, the simulation will demonstrate how Active Inference agents can optimize their actions to minimize expected free energy, leading to more robust and interpretable security protocols. This approach will also incorporate epistemic exploration to enhance the agent's ability to handle uncertainty.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will provide tangible examples of how Active Inference can improve cybersecurity, making AI systems more trustworthy and reliable. This will be particularly valuable for organizations and researchers interested in Explainable AI and Cognitive Security.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the technical challenge of implementing Active Inference in a simulation environment and the potential for the simulation to not accurately reflect real-world scenarios. However, these risks can be mitigated by collaborating with experts from the Active Inference Institute and using well-documented tools and frameworks.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The cost will be minimal, primarily involving time and computational resources. Utilizing open-source tools like RxInfer.jl will help keep costs low.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 1-2 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the simulation and the depth of analysis.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Weekly Reviews**: Regularly review the simulation setup and initial results to ensure alignment with the project objectives.
- **Monthly Assessment**: Conduct a detailed assessment after one month to evaluate the simulation's performance and make necessary adjustments.
- **Final Report**: Prepare a final report documenting the simulation, its findings, and implications for cybersecurity protocols.

**Collaborators/Resources:**
- **Active Inference Institute**: Utilize resources and expertise from the EduActive unit and the Symbolic Cognitive Robotics project.
- **PLAINTEXT Lab**: Collaborate with researchers at the PLAINTEXT Lab to ensure the simulation aligns with current research in Explainable AI and Cognitive Security.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Developing Active Inference-Based Cognitive Security Protocols

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and implement cognitive security protocols using Active Inference to enhance the detection and mitigation of cognitive attacks.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current cognitive security protocols often rely on traditional machine learning methods or static rule-based systems, which may not adequately address the dynamic and adaptive nature of cognitive attacks. These methods lack the flexibility and adaptability that Active Inference can offer.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will apply Active Inference to create adaptive cognitive security protocols that can learn and update their models based on new data and changing environments. By incorporating the Free Energy Principle and Bayesian inference, these protocols will be able to handle uncertainty and epistemic exploration more effectively, leading to more robust and adaptive security measures.

The risks include the complexity of implementing Active Inference in real-world security scenarios and the need for extensive testing to ensure the protocols are effective and secure. Collaborations with experts and thorough validation will help mitigate these risks.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The cost will involve time, computational resources, and potentially some funding for collaboration and testing. However, leveraging open-source tools and academic resources can keep costs manageable.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 3-6 months to complete, depending on the scope and complexity of the protocols being developed.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Integrating Active Inference with Multi-Agent Systems for Enhanced Security

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a multi-agent system that integrates Active Inference to enhance collective behavior and security protocols in complex, dynamic environments.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current multi-agent systems often use traditional reinforcement learning or decentralized control methods, which can be limited in their ability to handle complex interactions and uncertainties. These systems may lack the transparency and interpretability that Active Inference can provide.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will integrate Active Inference into a multi-agent system, allowing agents to optimize their actions based on the minimization of free energy. This will enable the system to handle complex interactions, epistemic uncertainty, and dynamic environments more effectively. The use of Bayesian inference and the Free Energy Principle will provide a robust framework for collective behavior and decision-making.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will revolutionize the way multi-agent systems are used in security contexts, providing highly adaptable, transparent, and interpretable security protocols. This will be crucial for large-scale security applications, such as those in government, finance, and critical infrastructure.
