Friston, and Christopher J. Whyte. This tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to active inference and its practical applications[3].\n- **YouTube Tutorial**: Watch the video tutorial on Active Inference by Ryan Smith, which covers the basics and applications of active inference in an interactive and question-answer format[2].\n\n**Initial Learning Objectives:**\n- Understand the fundamental principles of Active Inference, including the free energy principle and variational Bayesian inference.\n- Familiarize yourself with the concept of preference distributions and how rewards are treated in active inference.\n\n**Concrete Actions to Take:**\n- Complete the step-by-step tutorial and take notes on key concepts.\n- Engage with the YouTube live stream or its comments to clarify any questions.\n- Start exploring the GitHub repository for deep active inference agents using Monte-Carlo methods to understand the practical implementation[1].\n\n#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)\n\n**Key Concepts to Master:**\n- **Variational Free Energy**: Delve deeper into the mathematical formulation of variational free energy and its role in active inference.\n- **Generative Models**: Understand how
