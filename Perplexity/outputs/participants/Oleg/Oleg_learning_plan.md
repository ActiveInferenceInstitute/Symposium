### Learning Plan for Oleg: Active Inference and Autonomous Agents

#### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Tutorial on Active Inference**: Begin with the "A Step-by-Step Tutorial on Active Inference and its Application to Empirical Data" by Ryan Smith, Karl J. Friston, and Christopher J. Whyte. This tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to active inference and its practical applications[3].
- **YouTube Tutorial**: Watch the video tutorial on Active Inference by Ryan Smith, which covers the basics and applications of active inference in an interactive and question-answer format[2].

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the fundamental principles of Active Inference, including the free energy principle and variational Bayesian inference.
- Familiarize yourself with the concept of preference distributions and how rewards are treated in active inference.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Complete the step-by-step tutorial and take notes on key concepts.
- Engage with the YouTube live stream or its comments to clarify any questions.
- Start exploring the GitHub repository for deep active inference agents using Monte-Carlo methods to understand the practical implementation[1].

#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Variational Free Energy**: Delve deeper into the mathematical formulation of variational free energy and its role in active inference.
- **Generative Models**: Understand how generative models are used in active inference to make predictions and update beliefs.
- **Epistemic and Extrinsic Value**: Learn about the distinction between epistemic and extrinsic value in active inference and how agents balance these values.

**Practical Exercises or Projects:**
- **Implement a Simple Active Inference Agent**: Use the resources from the GitHub repository to implement a basic active inference agent in a simple environment, such as a grid world.
- **Experiment with Different EFE Functionals**: Follow the experiments outlined in the paper on deep active inference agents to compare different formulations of the expected free energy functional[1].

**Recommended Study Materials:**
- **"Active inference: demystified and compared"**: Read this paper to understand the discrete-state formulation of active inference and its comparison with reinforcement learning[4].
- **Neuromatch Academy Summer School**: Participate in or review the materials from the Neuromatch Academy Summer School, which includes content on computational neuroscience and deep learning[5].

**Community Engagement Opportunities:**
- **Active Inference Community**: Join the active inference community through the Active Inference Institute or forums like activeinference.org to engage with other researchers and practitioners.
- **Attend Webinars or Workshops**: Look for upcoming webinars or workshops on active inference and related topics to stay updated and network with peers.

#### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)

**Advanced Topics to Explore:**
- **Hierarchical Active Inference**: Study hierarchical active inference models and their applications in more complex decision-making scenarios[3].
- **Neuromodulatory Mechanisms**: Investigate how neuromodulatory mechanisms, such as those involving the locus coeruleus, are integrated into active inference models to enhance learning and adaptability[3].
