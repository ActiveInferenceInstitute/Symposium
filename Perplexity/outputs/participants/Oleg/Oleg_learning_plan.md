### Personalized Learning Plan for Oleg: Active Inference

#### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Tutorial Video:** Watch the "A Step-by-Step Tutorial on Active Inference and its Application to Empirical Data" by Ryan Smith, Karl Friston, and Christopher Whyte. This video provides a comprehensive introduction and practical application of Active Inference[2].
- **Research Paper:** Read "A Step-by-Step Tutorial on Active Inference and its Application to Empirical Data" (2021) by Ryan Smith, Karl Friston, and Christopher Whyte. This paper offers a detailed walkthrough of the mathematical basis and application of Active Inference[1].

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the core concepts of Active Inference, including the free energy principle and variational inference.
- Familiarize yourself with the different strands of Active Inference (discrete, continuous, and deep Active Inference).

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Implement the MATLAB code provided in the tutorial to get hands-on experience with discrete-state-space Active Inference.
- Join the Active Inference Institute's Discord channel to engage with the community and ask questions about the tutorial and paper[3].

#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Variational Inference:** Delve deeper into the mathematical basis of variational inference and its role in Active Inference.
- **Preference Distributions:** Understand how preference distributions are used in Active Inference to drive decision-making and action selection.
- **Deep Active Inference:** Explore the integration of Active Inference with deep learning techniques.

**Practical Exercises or Projects:**
- **Project 1:** Implement a simple discrete-state-space Active Inference model using MATLAB or Python. Use the code from the tutorial as a starting point.
- **Project 2:** Experiment with using deep neural networks to scale Active Inference, following the approach described by David Bloomin[3].

**Recommended Study Materials:**
- **Syllabus:** Follow the syllabus outlined in "Spinning Up in Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle" to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the prerequisites and core concepts[5].
- **Neuromatch Academy:** Enroll in the Neuromatch Academy summer school for computational neuroscience, which includes deep learning and reinforcement learning content relevant to Active Inference[5].

**Community Engagement Opportunities:**
- **Active Inference Institute:** Participate in the Active Inference Institute's livestreams and discussions to stay updated on the latest developments and engage with other researchers[3].
- **GitHub Repository:** Contribute to or follow the FEP and Active Inference Paper Repository on GitHub to stay updated on the latest research and implementations[1].

#### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)

**Advanced Topics to Explore:**
- **Multi-Agent Environments:** Study the approach of training Active Inference agents in multi-agent competitive environments as proposed by David Bloomin[3].
- **Scaling Active Inference:** Dive into the challenges and solutions for scaling Active Inference to more complex environments, including the use of deep neural networks[4].

**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**
- **Research Collaborations:** Reach out to researchers like Beren Millidge or Andrey Savchenko to explore potential collaborations on integrating Active Inference with deep learning and multi-agent systems.
- **Active Inference Community:** Engage with the broader Active Inference community through the institute's website, Twitter, and Discord to find collaborators and stay updated on new developments[3].

**Application Projects in Their Domain:**
- **Autonomous Agents:** Apply Active Inference to more complex autonomous agent scenarios, such as navigation in dynamic environments.
- **VLAs and Deep Learning:** Integrate VLA models with deep learning techniques to enhance the decision-making capabilities of autonomous agents.

**Skill-Building Activities:**
- **Bayesian Methods:** Deepen your understanding of Bayesian methods and their application in reinforcement learning and decision-making.
- **Computational Complexity:** Address the computational complexity of implementing Active Inference by exploring efficient algorithms and approximations.
