### Project Proposal 1: Implementing a Basic Active Inference Agent in a Grid World Environment

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create a simple active inference agent that can navigate and make decisions in a grid world environment, demonstrating the fundamental principles of active inference.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, active inference agents are often implemented in more complex environments using deep learning techniques, but these implementations can be computationally intensive and may not clearly illustrate the basic principles. The limits of current practice include the lack of straightforward, educational examples that newcomers to the field can use to understand active inference.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will use a step-by-step tutorial approach, leveraging resources like the GitHub repository for deep active inference agents and the "A Step-by-Step Tutorial on Active Inference" by Ryan Smith[3][4]. The new aspect is the focus on simplicity and educational clarity, making it easier for newcomers to grasp the core concepts of active inference. This approach will be successful because it provides a hands-on, intuitive introduction to active inference, allowing Oleg to solidify his understanding and create a practical example that can be shared with others.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will benefit Oleg by enhancing his practical skills in active inference and providing a clear, teachable example that can be shared within the active inference community. It will also contribute to the broader goal of making active inference more accessible and understandable for researchers and students.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risk is the potential for oversimplification, which might not fully capture the complexity and power of active inference. Additionally, there is a risk that the implementation may not run smoothly due to technical issues, but this can be mitigated by following established tutorials and seeking community support.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project should be low-cost, as it primarily involves using open-source resources and existing computational infrastructure.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take 1-2 weeks to complete, depending on the depth of implementation and the time dedicated to it.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: Complete the initial setup and basic agent implementation within the first week. Test the agent's ability to navigate the grid world.
- **Final Check Point**: Refine the agent's decision-making process using preference distributions and evaluate its performance in various scenarios within the grid world.

### Project Proposal 2: Integrating Active Inference with Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Agents

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop an autonomous agent that integrates active inference with deep reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance decision-making and adaptability in complex dynamic environments.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, active inference and deep RL are often used separately, with active inference typically applied to simpler environments and deep RL to more complex ones. The limits include the computational intractability of combining these methods and the lack of clear guidelines on how to integrate them effectively.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will leverage recent advancements in deep active inference agents, such as the use of Monte-Carlo methods and hierarchical models[3]. Oleg will integrate these approaches with deep RL techniques, focusing on scaling active inference to more complex environments. The success of this approach is anticipated because it combines the robust decision-making of active inference with the scalability of deep RL, potentially offering better performance in dynamic environments.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will significantly impact the development of autonomous agents, particularly in areas like robotics and autonomous vehicles, by providing a more robust and adaptive decision-making framework. It will also contribute to the broader field of AI research by demonstrating how active inference can be scaled and integrated with other AI techniques.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of integrating two different AI frameworks, potential computational challenges, and the need for significant debugging and optimization. Collaborating with other researchers, such as Denis Dimitrov or Andrey Savchenko, can help mitigate these risks.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project may require some investment in computational resources, especially if large-scale simulations are involved. However, much of the work can be done using existing infrastructure and open-source tools.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take 3-6 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the integration and the time dedicated to it.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: Successfully integrate the basic components of active inference and deep RL within 2 months. Test the agent in a simplified dynamic environment.
- **Final Check Point**: Evaluate the performance of the integrated agent in a complex dynamic environment within 6 months. Compare its performance with traditional deep RL agents.

### Project Proposal 3: Developing Hierarchical Active Inference Models for Complex Decision-Making Scenarios

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and apply hierarchical active inference models to complex decision-making scenarios, such as multi-task learning and hierarchical planning, to enhance the adaptability and robustness of autonomous agents.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, hierarchical active inference models are in the early stages of development, and their application to complex scenarios is limited. The limits include the lack of established methodologies for scaling hierarchical models and the computational challenges associated with these complex systems.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will build on recent research in hierarchical active inference, incorporating advanced Bayesian inference techniques and neuromodulatory mechanisms to enhance learning and adaptability[3][5]. Oleg will develop a systematic approach to scaling hierarchical models, leveraging deep learning architectures and Monte-Carlo methods. The success of this approach is anticipated because it addresses the current limitations by providing a structured methodology for hierarchical active inference and integrating it with advanced AI techniques.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will have a significant impact on the field of AI by providing a robust framework for complex decision-making in autonomous agents. It will benefit applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and other areas requiring hierarchical planning and multi-task learning.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of developing hierarchical models, the need for significant computational resources, and the potential for instability in the learning process. Collaboration with other researchers and the use of established tutorials and resources can help mitigate these risks.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project may require substantial investment in computational resources and potentially some funding for attending relevant conferences or workshops.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take 6-12 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the hierarchical models and the time dedicated to it.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: Develop a basic hierarchical active inference model and test its performance in a simplified multi-task scenario within 6 months.
- **Final Check Point**: Evaluate the performance of the hierarchical model in a complex, dynamic environment involving multi-task learning and hierarchical planning within 12 months. Compare its performance with other state-of-the-art AI models.
