### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)

#### Specific Resources to Start With
- **Jared Tumiel's Syllabus**: Begin with the syllabus on Spinning Up in Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the necessary background and a structured approach to learning[1].
- **Prof. Karl Friston's Video**: Watch the YouTube video where Prof. Karl Friston explains Active Inference, perceptual inference, and the differences between Active Inference and reinforcement learning. This will give a foundational understanding from the theory's originator[5].

#### Initial Learning Objectives
- Understand the basic concepts of Active Inference, including the Free Energy Principle and Bayesian inference.
- Recognize the differences between Active Inference and reinforcement learning.
- Familiarize yourself with the key terms and concepts in the field.

#### Concrete Actions to Take
- Spend 2-3 hours each day for the next two weeks going through Jared Tumiel's syllabus, focusing on the introductory materials and prerequisites.
- Watch Prof. Karl Friston's video and take notes on the key points discussed.
- Join online forums or discussion groups related to Active Inference to introduce yourself and ask initial questions.

### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)

#### Key Concepts to Master
- **Free Energy Principle**: Delve deeper into the mathematical and conceptual underpinnings of the Free Energy Principle and its application in Active Inference.
- **Bayesian Inference**: Understand how Bayesian methods are applied in Active Inference, including belief updating and prediction error minimization.
- **Agent-Environment Loop**: Study the agent-environment loop in Active Inference, including state-action mappings and decision-making schemes[3].

#### Practical Exercises or Projects
- **Neuromatch Academy**: Participate in the Neuromatch Academy's online courses or summer school, which cover computational neuroscience and include deep learning and reinforcement learning content. This will help in setting up experiments and designing simulations[1].
- **Simple Simulation Projects**: Start with simple simulation projects using tools like OpenAI Gym (e.g., Cart Pole environment) to apply Active Inference concepts in a practical setting[3].

#### Recommended Study Materials
- **Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms by David MacKay**: Use this textbook as a reference for detailed questions on information theory and Bayesian inference[1].
- **Active Inference Papers**: Read papers such as "Active inference and learning" to deepen your understanding of choice behavior, learning, and the distinction between goal-directed and habitual behavior[4].

#### Community Engagement Opportunities
- **Join Online Forums**: Engage with communities like Reddit's r/MachineLearning and r/Neuroscience, or specific Active Inference groups on platforms like GitHub or Discord.
- **Attend Webinars or Online Seminars**: Look for webinars or online seminars on Active Inference and related topics to interact with other researchers and learners.

### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)

#### Advanced Topics to Explore
- **Scaling Active Inference**: Study how to scale Active Inference using deep neural networks, as discussed in Beren's retrospective on Active Inference. This includes understanding the relationship between Active Inference and deep reinforcement learning[2].
- **Predictive Planning and Counterfactual Learning**: Explore advanced decision-making schemes such as the DPEFE scheme and the CL method, and understand how they integrate with predictive planning and counterfactual learning[3].

#### Potential Collaboration Opportunities
- **Interdisciplinary Projects**: Collaborate with researchers from neuroscience, psychology, and computer science on projects that apply Active Inference to real-world problems, such as in education or healthcare.
- **Community Outreach**: Work with educators or science communicators to develop materials that explain Active Inference in accessible terms for non-academic audiences.

#### Application Projects in Their Domain
- **Mobile App Development**: Continue developing the mobile app that integrates music library and social networking features using Active Inference principles. This could involve incorporating more advanced decision-making schemes and user preference updates.
- **User Behavior Analysis**: Apply Active Inference to analyze user behavior and preference changes within the app, providing insights into how users interact with the app over time.

#### Skill-Building Activities
- **Programming Skills**: Enhance programming skills in languages such as Python, focusing on libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch for implementing Active Inference models.
- **Mathematical Foundations**: Deepen mathematical understanding by studying topics such as control theory, cybernetics, and advanced Bayesian inference.
