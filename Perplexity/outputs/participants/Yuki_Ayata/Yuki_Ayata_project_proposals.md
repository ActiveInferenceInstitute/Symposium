### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Active Inference Mobile App Enhancement

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Enhance the existing mobile app that integrates music library and social networking features by incorporating basic Active Inference principles to improve user preference updates and decision-making.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, the app uses traditional recommendation algorithms that do not adapt to user behavior in real-time. The limits include static user profiles, lack of real-time feedback incorporation, and limited personalization.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
Integrate Active Inference by implementing a simple agent-environment loop where the app learns user preferences through continuous interaction. This approach will use Bayesian inference to update user models based on their actions, enhancing the app's ability to adapt and personalize recommendations.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Users will experience more personalized music recommendations and social interactions, leading to higher engagement and satisfaction. This project can also serve as a proof-of-concept for applying Active Inference in consumer apps.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks are the complexity of integrating Active Inference into an existing app, potential computational overhead, and the need for robust testing to ensure the new features do not degrade user experience.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will primarily require time and effort, with minimal additional costs. Estimated costs include any necessary software tools or consulting fees, which should be relatively low.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 2-3 months, given the scope and the participant's current skills.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: Successful integration of the agent-environment loop and initial user model updates (1 month).
- **Final Check Point**: Completion of the enhanced app with user testing and feedback analysis (3 months).

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Developing Educational Materials for Active Inference

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create a comprehensive set of educational materials, including videos, tutorials, and interactive simulations, to explain Active Inference principles in an accessible manner for non-technical audiences.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, educational materials on Active Inference are largely technical and academic, making it difficult for non-experts to understand. The limits include the lack of engaging and simplified content.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
Utilize multimedia resources such as videos, animations, and interactive simulations to illustrate key concepts of Active Inference. Collaborate with educators and science communicators to ensure the content is engaging and easy to understand.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
These materials will make Active Inference more accessible to a broader audience, including students, educators, and the general public. This can lead to increased interest and understanding of the field.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks are ensuring the accuracy and simplicity of the content, managing collaborations with multiple stakeholders, and the potential for high production costs for high-quality multimedia content.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
Estimated costs include software and equipment for video production, consulting fees for educators and science communicators, and potential hosting fees for online materials.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 6-9 months, considering the production time and collaborations involved.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: Completion of initial video scripts and prototype simulations (3 months).
- **Final Check Point**: Finalization and release of the educational materials with feedback from pilot testing (9 months).

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Scaling Active Inference with Deep Neural Networks for Complex Decision-Making

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and implement a scalable Active Inference framework using deep neural networks to handle complex decision-making tasks in real-world applications, such as healthcare or education.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, Active Inference models are often limited to simple environments and do not scale well to complex, real-world scenarios. The limits include computational complexity and the lack of robust scaling methods.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
Integrate deep neural networks into the Active Inference framework to enhance its scalability and ability to handle complex environments. Utilize advanced decision-making schemes such as the DPEFE scheme and counterfactual learning to improve the model's performance.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project can significantly impact various fields by providing a scalable and robust framework for complex decision-making. It can improve patient care in healthcare, enhance educational outcomes, and contribute to more intelligent and adaptive systems.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the technical challenges of integrating deep neural networks with Active Inference, ensuring the model's interpretability and explainability, and the potential for high computational costs.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
Estimated costs include significant computational resources, potential software and consulting fees, and possibly funding for collaborations with other researchers or institutions.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 1-2 years, considering the complexity and the need for extensive testing and validation.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: Successful integration of deep neural networks with the Active Inference framework and initial testing in simplified environments (6 months).
- **Final Check Point**: Completion of the scalable framework with extensive testing and validation in real-world scenarios (2 years).
