### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Active Inference in Music Preference Shaping

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a mobile app that uses Active Inference to shape and adapt to a user's music preferences, enhancing the user experience and personalization.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, music recommendation systems rely heavily on collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and sometimes machine learning algorithms. However, these methods often lack a deep understanding of the user's internal states and preferences, leading to recommendations that may not fully align with the user's current mood or context. The limits include a lack of adaptability to real-time user feedback and an inability to integrate multiple sources of information (e.g., user behavior, environmental context).

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will integrate Active Inference principles to create an adaptive music recommendation system. By modeling the user's internal states and preferences using variational free energy minimization, the app can better predict and adapt to the user's music preferences in real-time. This approach leverages Yuki Ayata's background in app development and IT, combined with the theoretical foundation of Active Inference.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will make a significant difference for music streaming services and their users. Users will experience more personalized and context-aware music recommendations, enhancing their overall music listening experience. This can lead to higher user satisfaction and retention rates for music streaming services.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- The complexity of implementing Active Inference models in a real-world app could pose technical challenges.
- Ensuring the model's accuracy and adaptability to diverse user preferences is a risk.
- User acceptance and feedback on the new recommendation system could be unpredictable.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The cost will be relatively low since it involves leveraging existing app development frameworks and open-source tools like OpenAI Gym. Estimated costs include:
- Time and effort for development and testing (~2-3 months).
- Potential costs for data storage and computational resources for model training.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 2-3 months to complete, including development, testing, and initial deployment.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint (1 month):** Successful implementation of a basic Active Inference model in the app.
- **Final Checkpoint (3 months):** User testing and feedback collection to validate the app's performance and user experience.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Developing an SNS App Using Active Inference

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create a social networking service (SNS) app that utilizes Active Inference to help users explore and exploit their favorite content in a personalized and engaging manner.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current SNS apps rely on algorithms that prioritize engagement metrics, such as likes and shares, which can lead to echo chambers and decreased user satisfaction. These algorithms lack a deep understanding of individual user preferences and internal states, resulting in a less personalized experience.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will apply Active Inference to model user preferences and internal states, allowing the app to adapt content recommendations in real-time. By minimizing variational free energy, the app can better align with the user's current interests and context. Yuki Ayata's experience in IT and app development, combined with their growing expertise in Active Inference, makes this approach feasible and promising.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will significantly improve the user experience on SNS platforms. Users will see more relevant and personalized content, reducing the likelihood of encountering irrelevant or annoying posts. This can lead to higher user engagement and satisfaction.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- Integrating Active Inference into a complex SNS app poses significant technical challenges.
- Ensuring user privacy and data security while using advanced modeling techniques is a risk.
- User acceptance and feedback on the new content recommendation system could be unpredictable.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The cost will include:
- Time and effort for development and testing (~6-9 months).
- Potential costs for data storage, computational resources, and possibly hiring additional expertise.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 6-9 months to complete, including development, testing, and initial deployment.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint (3 months):** Successful implementation of a basic Active Inference model for content recommendation.
- **Mid-term Checkpoint (6 months):** User testing and feedback collection to validate the app's performance and user experience.
- **Final Checkpoint (9 months):** Full deployment and assessment of the app's impact on user engagement and satisfaction.

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Hybrid Active Inference Models for Personalized Health and Wellness

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a hybrid Active Inference model that integrates both discrete and continuous variables to create a personalized health and wellness system. This system will adapt to individual users' health data, preferences, and environmental context to provide tailored health recommendations.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current health and wellness apps often use simplistic models that do not fully account for the complexity of human behavior and internal states. These models lack the ability to integrate multiple sources of data (e.g., wearable devices, user input, environmental factors) and fail to adapt to changing user needs in real-time.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will leverage the latest advancements in hybrid Active Inference models to create a comprehensive health and wellness system. By integrating discrete and continuous variables, the model can capture a wide range of health-related data and adapt recommendations accordingly. Yuki Ayata's unique blend of IT expertise and growing knowledge in Active Inference, coupled with potential collaborations with researchers in neuroscience and health sciences, makes this approach promising.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will have a significant impact on public health by providing highly personalized and adaptive health recommendations. Users will benefit from more accurate and relevant advice, leading to better health outcomes and improved quality of life.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- The complexity of developing and validating a hybrid Active Inference model is high.
- Ensuring data privacy and security while handling sensitive health data is a critical risk.
- User acceptance and adherence to the recommendations provided by the system could be challenging.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The cost will include:
- Time and effort for development and testing (~12-18 months).
- Potential costs for data storage, computational resources, hiring additional expertise, and possibly conducting clinical trials.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 12-18 months to complete, including development, testing, and validation.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?

- **Mid-term Checkpoint (9 months):** Initial user testing and feedback collection.
- **Mid-term Checkpoint (12 months):** Comprehensive validation of the model's accuracy and effectiveness.
- **Final Checkpoint (18 months):** Full deployment and long-term assessment of the system's impact on user health and wellness.
