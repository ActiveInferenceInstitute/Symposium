### Detailed Learning Plan for Scott David on Active Inference

#### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Active Inference Institute Livestreams:** Start by watching the recent and upcoming livestreams from the Active Inference Institute, particularly those that align with your interests in risk management and policy domains. For example, the "Applied Active Inference Symposium" on November 13-14, 2024, could be highly relevant[2].
- **Introduction to Active Inference:** Begin with the introductory materials provided in the "Spinning Up in Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle" syllabus. Focus on the short, intuitive primers to get a feel for the theory before diving deeper into technical details[1].

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Gain a basic understanding of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference.
- Understand the core concepts of generative models, Bayesian inference, and free-energy minimization.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Watch the introductory videos and read the short primers from the "Spinning Up in Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle" syllabus.
- Join the Active Inference Institute Discord to engage with the community and ask questions.
- Review the upcoming livestreams and plan to attend or watch the recordings of those that are most relevant.

#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Generative Models and Bayesian Inference:** Delve deeper into the mathematical and computational aspects of generative models and Bayesian inference.
- **Free-Energy Minimization:** Understand how the free-energy principle drives action selection and perception in active inference.
- **Hierarchical Generative Models:** Learn about the role of hierarchical models in active inference, especially in relation to self-modelling and consciousness[5].

**Practical Exercises or Projects:**
- **Simulation Tasks:** Use tools like PyMDP or other software frameworks mentioned in the Active Inference Institute resources to simulate simple active inference models.
- **Case Studies:** Apply active inference to case studies related to risk management and policy domains, analyzing how the framework can be used to model and predict behaviors.

**Recommended Study Materials:**
- **Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms by David MacKay:** This textbook provides detailed information on information theory and Bayesian inference, which are crucial for understanding active inference[1].
- **Computational Psychiatry Course:** This course is particularly relevant for understanding the computational basis of psychiatric disorders and can provide insights into applying active inference in complex behavioral models[1].

**Community Engagement Opportunities:**
- **Active Inference Institute Events:** Participate in the Applied Active Inference Symposium and other events hosted by the Active Inference Institute.
