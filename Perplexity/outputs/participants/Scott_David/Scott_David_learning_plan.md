### Detailed Learning Plan for Scott David on Active Inference

#### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Syllabus for Free Energy Principle and Active Inference**: Start with the syllabus provided by Jared Tumiel, which offers a structured approach to understanding the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference. Focus on the introductory materials and prerequisites to get a feel for the full construct[4].
- **Introduction to Active Inference**: Read the overview of the active inference framework from the paper "Consciousness in active inference: Deep self-models, other minds..." to understand the core mechanics and its application to consciousness and subjectivity[2].

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the basic principles of Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle.
- Familiarize yourself with the key concepts such as generative models, Bayesian inference, and free energy minimization.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Spend 2-3 hours per day for the next two weeks reading through the introductory sections of the syllabus and the paper on consciousness in active inference.
- Watch introductory videos on Active Inference, such as those available on the Neuromatch Academy platform, to supplement your reading[4].

#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Generative Models and Bayesian Inference**: Delve deeper into how generative models are used in Active Inference and how Bayesian inference is applied to state transitions and policy selection[2][5].
- **Free Energy Minimization**: Understand how free energy is minimized in the context of action selection and policy optimization[2][5].
- **Embodied Decisions**: Study the model of embodied decisions as presented in the bioRxiv paper, focusing on evidence accumulation, motor planning, motor inference, and statistical learning[1].

**Practical Exercises or Projects:**
- **Simulations**: Use simulations, such as those described in the bioRxiv paper, to understand embodied decisions. Implement simple simulations using Python or MATLAB to visualize the processes of evidence accumulation and motor inference.
- **Case Studies**: Apply Active Inference to case studies in information risk management and policy, using real-world scenarios to test your understanding.

**Recommended Study Materials:**
- **Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms by David MacKay**: This textbook provides detailed information on information theory and Bayesian inference, which are crucial for understanding Active Inference[4].
- **Computational Psychiatry Course**: While focused on psychiatry, this course can provide valuable insights into the computational basis of Active Inference and its application to complex systems[4].

**Community Engagement Opportunities:**
- **Active Inference Institute Workshops**: Participate in workshops or webinars hosted by the Active Inference Institute to engage with the community and learn from experts.
- **Boston Global Forum**: Attend or participate in online forums and discussions organized by the Boston Global Forum to integrate Active Inference with global policy and AI development[3].

#### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)

**Advanced Topics to Explore:**
- **Extended Active Inference**: Study the concept of extended active inference and cognitive niche construction, which could enhance your understanding of how Active Inference applies beyond individual organisms[3].
- **Deep Self-Modelling**: Dive deeper into the self-modelling theory of subjectivity within Active Inference, including the role of deep generative models and allostatic control[2][5].

**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**
- **Collaborate with Active Inference Institute Members**: Work on joint projects or research papers with other members of the Active Inference Institute, such as Daniel Ari Friedman and Karl Friston.
- **Interdisciplinary Projects**: Engage in interdisciplinary projects involving researchers from neuroscience, biology, policy, and conflict studies to integrate Active Inference with broader frameworks.

**Application Projects in Their Domain:**
- **Risk Management Models**: Develop and apply Active Inference models to information risk management scenarios, integrating with other conflict and interaction characterizations.
- **Policy Development**: Use Active Inference to inform policy development in areas such as digital risk, privacy, and emerging intangibles value propositions.

**Skill-Building Activities:**
- **Coding Skills**: Enhance your coding skills in Python or MATLAB to implement more complex simulations and models.
- **Interdisciplinary Workshops**: Attend workshops that combine computational neuroscience, biology, and policy to deepen your understanding of the interdisciplinary applications of Active Inference.
