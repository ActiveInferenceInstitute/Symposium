### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Applying Active Inference to Risk Management Case Studies

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and apply active inference models to real-world risk management case studies to enhance predictive capabilities and decision-making.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, risk management often relies on traditional statistical models and qualitative analyses. These methods can be limited by their inability to fully capture the dynamic and interactive nature of risk environments. They also lack the integrative power of active inference, which can incorporate both sensory feedback and action policies to make more accurate predictions.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will utilize the active inference framework to model risk management scenarios. By integrating generative models, Bayesian inference, and free-energy minimization, the approach will allow for the dynamic adjustment of risk assessments based on real-time data and action outcomes. This method is expected to be successful because it leverages the robust predictive capabilities of active inference, which have been shown to outperform traditional methods in complex, dynamic environments[4].

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will benefit risk managers, policymakers, and stakeholders in commercial and governmental entities by providing a more accurate and adaptive tool for risk assessment. It will enhance decision-making by incorporating the feedback loop of actions and outcomes, leading to better risk mitigation strategies.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risks include the complexity of implementing active inference models, the need for high-quality data, and the potential for initial resistance to adopting a new methodology. However, these risks can be mitigated by starting with well-defined case studies and gradually scaling up the complexity of the models.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The initial costs will be minimal, primarily involving time and computational resources. Access to existing datasets and collaboration with other researchers can reduce costs further.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 1-3 months to complete the initial phase, including data collection, model development, and preliminary analysis.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point:** After one month, evaluate the feasibility of the active inference models on a small set of case studies. Assess the accuracy of predictions and the ease of implementation.
- **Final Check Point:** After three months, compare the performance of active inference models against traditional risk management methods. Document the outcomes and prepare a report for stakeholders.

**Collaborators/Resources:**
- Collaborate with researchers from the Active Inference Institute.
- Utilize the "Spinning Up in Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle" syllabus for methodological guidance.
- Leverage datasets and case studies from the Information Risk and Synthetic Intelligence Research Initiative (IRSIRI).

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with Conflict Studies for Policy Analysis

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop an integrated framework that combines active inference with conflict studies to analyze and predict policy outcomes in complex, dynamic environments.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, policy analysis often uses separate frameworks for conflict studies and predictive modeling. These approaches can be fragmented and fail to capture the full interplay between actions, perceptions, and outcomes. The integration of active inference can provide a more holistic and systems-level perspective.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will integrate active inference models with conflict studies to create a comprehensive framework for policy analysis. By using hierarchical generative models and free-energy minimization, the approach will account for the dynamic interactions between policy actions, public perceptions, and environmental changes. This integrated framework is expected to be successful because it leverages the predictive power of active inference to model complex systems and behaviors, which is particularly relevant in policy domains[4].

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will benefit policymakers, researchers in conflict studies, and stakeholders in governmental and international organizations. It will provide a more robust and adaptive tool for policy analysis, enabling better decision-making and more effective policy implementation.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The risks include the complexity of integrating different theoretical frameworks, the need for diverse datasets, and potential resistance from stakeholders accustomed to traditional methods. However, these risks can be managed through careful planning, collaboration with experts in both active inference and conflict studies, and incremental validation of the framework.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The costs will include time, computational resources, and potentially some funding for data collection and collaboration. However, leveraging existing resources from the University of Washington and the Active Inference Institute can help minimize costs.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 6-12 months to complete, including the development of the integrated framework, data collection, and validation.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point:** After six months, evaluate the feasibility of the integrated framework on a set of case studies. Assess the accuracy of predictions and the ease of implementation.
- **Final Check Point:** After one year, compare the performance of the integrated framework against traditional policy analysis methods. Document the outcomes and prepare a comprehensive report for stakeholders.

**Collaborators/Resources:**
- Collaborate with researchers from the Active Inference Institute and experts in conflict studies.
- Utilize the "Spinning Up in Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle" syllabus and resources from the University of Washington.
- Leverage datasets and case studies from the Information Risk and Synthetic Intelligence Research Initiative (IRSIRI) and other relevant sources.

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing a Global Active Inference Framework for Policy and Risk Management

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a global, scalable active inference framework that can be applied to various policy and risk management domains, facilitating international collaboration and standardized practices.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, policy and risk management frameworks are often fragmented and localized, lacking a unified global approach. This fragmentation hinders international collaboration and the sharing of best practices. The existing methods also fail to fully integrate the dynamic and interactive aspects of global systems.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will develop a comprehensive, hierarchical active inference framework that can be applied globally. By leveraging deep neurophenomenology, embodied decisions, and free-energy minimization, the framework will account for the complex interactions between global policies, public perceptions, and environmental changes. This approach is expected to be successful because it integrates insights from computational neuroscience, biology, and physics, providing a robust and adaptable tool for global policy and risk management[4].

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will benefit global policymakers, international organizations, and stakeholders across various sectors. It will provide a standardized, adaptive framework for policy and risk management, enhancing global cooperation, decision-making, and the effectiveness of policy implementation.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The risks include the complexity of developing a global framework, the need for extensive data collection and validation, and potential resistance from diverse stakeholders. However, these risks can be managed through careful planning, international collaboration, and incremental validation of the framework.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The costs will be significant and will include funding for data collection, computational resources, and international collaboration. However, securing grants from global organizations and leveraging resources from the University of Washington and the Active Inference Institute can help support this endeavor.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 2-5 years to complete, including the development of the framework, global data collection, validation, and implementation.
