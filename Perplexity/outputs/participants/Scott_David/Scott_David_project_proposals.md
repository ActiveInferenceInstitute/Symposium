### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Applying Active Inference to Information Risk Management Scenarios

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and apply Active Inference models to manage information risk in specific, real-world scenarios, such as data breaches or cyberattacks, to improve predictive capabilities and response strategies.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, information risk management often relies on traditional statistical models and reactive strategies. These methods lack the proactive and adaptive capabilities that Active Inference can provide, leading to limitations in predicting and mitigating complex risks.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
The new approach involves integrating Active Inference with existing risk management frameworks to create more adaptive and predictive models. By using generative models and Bayesian inference, this method can better anticipate and respond to dynamic risk environments. The success of this approach hinges on the ability of Active Inference to minimize prediction errors through continuous learning and adaptation.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will benefit organizations and governments by enhancing their ability to predict and manage information risks more effectively. It will lead to better protection of sensitive data, reduced financial losses from breaches, and improved overall cybersecurity.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risks include the complexity of implementing Active Inference in practical settings, the need for significant computational resources, and the potential for initial model inaccuracies. However, these risks can be mitigated through iterative testing and refinement.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The initial costs will be relatively low, focusing on software tools, computational resources, and potentially some consulting fees. Estimated costs could range from $10,000 to $50,000, depending on the scope and complexity.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project can be completed within 2-3 months. The timeline includes:
- 1 month for literature review and model development
- 1 month for simulation and testing
- 1 month for implementation and feedback

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Monthly Review**: Assess the progress of model development, simulation outcomes, and initial implementation results.
- **Mid-term Checkpoint**: Evaluate the accuracy and predictive power of the Active Inference models in controlled scenarios.
- **Final Checkpoint**: Implement the models in real-world settings and assess their performance in managing information risks.

**Resources and Collaborators:**
- Utilize the Active Inference Institute's educational resources and workshops.
- Collaborate with cybersecurity experts and risk management professionals.
- Use software tools like Neuromatch Academy resources and OpenAI Gym for simulations.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with Conflict Studies

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a comprehensive framework that integrates Active Inference with conflict studies to better understand and predict conflict dynamics in various contexts, such as international relations, social unrest, or organizational conflicts.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current conflict studies often rely on static models and qualitative analyses. These approaches lack the dynamic and adaptive capabilities needed to predict complex conflict behaviors. Active Inference can fill this gap by providing a more nuanced and predictive framework.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
The new approach involves using Active Inference to model the dynamic interactions between agents in conflict scenarios. By applying generative models and minimizing free energy, this method can predict and explain the behaviors of conflicting parties more accurately. Success depends on the ability to capture the complex interactions and feedback loops inherent in conflict dynamics.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will benefit policymakers, conflict resolution specialists, and scholars by providing a more sophisticated tool for understanding and predicting conflicts. It can lead to more effective conflict resolution strategies and improved international relations.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risks include the complexity of modeling complex conflict scenarios, the need for extensive data, and potential inaccuracies in initial models. These risks can be mitigated through iterative refinement and collaboration with experts in conflict studies.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
Estimated costs could range from $50,000 to $200,000, depending on the scope, data collection needs, and potential consulting fees.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project can be completed within 6-9 months. The timeline includes:
- 3 months for literature review and framework development
- 3 months for model testing and validation
- 3 months for implementation and feedback

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Quarterly Review**: Assess the progress of framework development, model testing, and initial implementation results.
- **Mid-term Checkpoint**: Evaluate the predictive power of the Active Inference models in controlled conflict scenarios.
- **Final Checkpoint**: Implement the models in real-world conflict scenarios and assess their performance in predicting and resolving conflicts.

**Resources and Collaborators:**
- Collaborate with the Active Inference Institute and experts in conflict studies.
- Use resources such as the Boston Global Forum and the World Economic Forum for data and expert input.
- Utilize computational neuroscience and deep learning resources from Neuromatch Academy.

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing Active LLMs for Enhanced AI Self-Awareness

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop Large Language Models (LLMs) that operate under the principles of Active Inference, enabling them to become more adaptive, self-aware, and capable of interacting with their environment in a more agentic manner.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current LLMs are primarily passive predictors and lack the self-awareness and adaptive capabilities that Active Inference can provide. This limits their ability to interact meaningfully with their environment and users.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
The new approach involves integrating Active Inference principles into LLM architectures, enabling these models to minimize prediction errors through continuous learning and adaptation. This will create LLMs that are more self-aware and capable of changing their environment to match their internal predictions. Success hinges on the ability to close the feedback loop between action and perception in these models.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will significantly impact the development of AI by creating more adaptive and self-aware systems. It will benefit various stakeholders, including AI researchers, policymakers, and users, by providing more sophisticated and interactive AI models.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risks include the technical challenges of integrating Active Inference into complex LLM architectures, potential societal implications of more agentic AI, and the need for robust ethical frameworks. These risks can be mitigated through careful design, testing, and collaboration with ethicists and policymakers.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
Estimated costs could range from $200,000 to $1 million, depending on the complexity of the project, the need for significant computational resources, and potential consulting fees.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project can be completed within 1-2 years. The timeline includes:
- 6 months for literature review and framework development
- 6 months for model design and initial testing
- 6 months for extensive testing and validation
