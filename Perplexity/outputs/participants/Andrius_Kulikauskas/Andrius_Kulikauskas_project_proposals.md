### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Implementing Simple Active Inference Models

#### What are you trying to do?
Develop and implement simple Active Inference models to understand the practical implications of the theory, particularly in the context of decision-making and neural systems.

#### How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, Active Inference models are often developed and implemented by experts with a strong background in neuroscience and statistical mechanics. However, for newcomers like Andrius Kulikauskas, the complexity of these models and the lack of accessible tutorials can be significant barriers. Existing resources may not be tailored for those with a philosophical and mathematical background but limited experience in Active Inference.

#### What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project involves creating step-by-step guides and tutorials for implementing simple Active Inference models using software tools like MATLAB or Python. Andrius Kulikauskas will leverage his experience in communicating complex ideas to develop educational materials that bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical implementation. The approach will be successful because it will provide a clear, structured learning path for others with similar backgrounds, making it easier to enter the field.

#### Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will benefit the broader Active Inference community, especially those from philosophical and mathematical backgrounds who are new to the field. By providing accessible tutorials and guides, it will lower the entry barrier and encourage more interdisciplinary participation. This could lead to new insights and applications as more diverse perspectives are brought into the field.

#### What are the risks?
- The risk of oversimplifying complex concepts, which might not fully capture the nuances of Active Inference.
- The challenge of ensuring that the tutorials are both accurate and engaging for a diverse audience.

#### How much will it cost?
The cost will be minimal, primarily involving time and effort. Any software tools required (e.g., MATLAB or Python) are likely already available or can be accessed through academic licenses.

#### How long will it take?
This project can be completed within 1-3 months, depending on the complexity of the models and the depth of the tutorials.

#### What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point:** Completion of the first set of tutorials and initial feedback from a small group of testers (1 month).
- **Final Check Point:** Publication of the complete set of tutorials and guides, along with feedback from a broader audience (3 months).

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Wondrous Wisdom with Active Inference

#### What are you trying to do?
Develop a theoretical framework that integrates Andrius Kulikauskas's philosophical framework, Wondrous Wisdom, with the principles of Active Inference. This integration aims to provide new insights into decision-making and perception from a philosophical and mathematical perspective.

#### How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, Active Inference is primarily discussed within the contexts of neuroscience and statistical mechanics. While there are some interdisciplinary efforts, a systematic integration with philosophical frameworks like Wondrous Wisdom is lacking. The limits of current practice include the lack of a coherent theoretical framework that combines these perspectives.

#### What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will involve a detailed analysis of both Wondrous Wisdom and Active Inference, identifying key concepts and mechanisms that can be integrated. Andrius Kulikauskas will use his "Theory Translator" initiative as a foundation to align the philosophical and mathematical aspects of both frameworks. The success of this approach hinges on the unique blend of Andrius's expertise in philosophy and mathematics, which can facilitate a meaningful and coherent integration.

#### Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This integration will be significant for both the Active Inference community and the broader philosophical community. It will provide new theoretical insights into how perception and decision-making can be understood through a combined philosophical and mathematical lens. This could lead to innovative applications in fields such as artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and neuroscience.

#### What are the risks?
- The risk of incompatibility between the two frameworks, leading to inconsistencies or contradictions.
- The challenge of communicating complex ideas across different disciplinary communities.

#### How much will it cost?
The cost will primarily be in terms of time and effort. Potential collaborations with experts from the Active Inference Institute or other relevant fields may require some travel or conference attendance costs.

#### How long will it take?
This project is expected to take around 6-9 months to complete, depending on the depth of the integration and the complexity of the theoretical framework.

#### What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point:** Completion of a draft integrating key concepts from both frameworks and initial feedback from peers (3 months).
- **Final Check Point:** Publication of the final theoretical framework in an academic journal or presentation at a conference (9 months).

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Applying Active Inference to Complex Systems

#### What are you trying to do?
Apply Active Inference principles to model and analyze the behavior of complex systems, such as ant colonies or social networks, using advanced statistical mechanics and the Variational / Renormalization Group / Multiscale Active Inference scaffold.

#### How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, Active Inference is primarily applied to individual agents or small-scale systems. Applying it to complex systems involves significant computational and theoretical challenges. The limits of current practice include the lack of scalable models that can handle the complexity of large-scale systems.

#### What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will involve developing and implementing advanced Active Inference models that can scale to complex systems. Andrius Kulikauskas will leverage his background in mathematics and philosophy to develop a theoretical framework that integrates the free energy principle with principles from statistical mechanics and complex systems theory. The success of this approach depends on the ability to adapt and extend existing Active Inference models to handle the complexity of large-scale systems, which could be facilitated by collaborations with experts in complex systems and statistical mechanics.

#### Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will have significant implications for fields such as ecology, sociology, and artificial intelligence. By applying Active Inference to complex systems, it could provide new insights into collective behavior, decision-making processes, and the emergence of complex phenomena. This could lead to innovative applications in managing and predicting the behavior of complex systems.

#### What are the risks?
- The risk of encountering insurmountable computational challenges.
- The challenge of ensuring that the models remain interpretable and aligned with real-world observations.

#### How much will it cost?
The cost will include time, effort, and potentially some funding for software tools, computational resources, or travel to collaborate with other experts. The estimated cost could range from a few thousand dollars to tens of thousands, depending on the scope and resources needed.

#### How long will it take?
This project is expected to take around 1-2 years to complete, given the complexity of the task and the need for extensive testing and validation.

#### What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point:** Completion of the theoretical framework and initial implementation of the models (6 months).
- **Final Check Point:** Publication of the results in a peer-reviewed journal and presentation at a major conference (1-2 years).

Each of these proposals aligns with Andrius Kulikauskas's background, interests, and learning needs, providing a structured pathway for deepening his understanding and application of Active Inference.
