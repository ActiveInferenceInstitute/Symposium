### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with Wondrous Wisdom through Educational Content

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create a series of educational videos and blog posts that integrate Active Inference concepts with the philosophical framework of Wondrous Wisdom, making both subjects more accessible and understandable to a broader audience.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, educational content on Active Inference is often technical and specialized, limiting its accessibility to those without a strong background in mathematics and neuroscience. The integration of Active Inference with philosophical frameworks like Wondrous Wisdom is not well-represented in existing educational resources.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
The new approach involves leveraging Andrius Kulikauskas's unique blend of mathematical and philosophical expertise to create content that bridges the gap between technical Active Inference concepts and philosophical insights. This will be successful because it combines the clarity of educational content with the depth of interdisciplinary integration, making the subject more engaging and comprehensible.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will benefit students, researchers, and practitioners interested in both Active Inference and philosophical frameworks. By making these concepts more accessible, it will facilitate a broader understanding and adoption of Active Inference principles, potentially inspiring new researchers and practitioners.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risk is the challenge of translating complex technical and philosophical concepts into clear, educational content without losing their essence. Additionally, there is a risk of not reaching the intended audience due to the niche nature of the topic.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require minimal costs, primarily related to video production and hosting. Estimated costs could include:
- Video recording equipment: $500
- Hosting fees for videos and blog posts: $100/month
- Time and effort: valued at $0 since it leverages existing expertise.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project can be completed within 2-3 months, with the following timeline:
- Month 1: Develop a content plan and script the first set of videos and blog posts.
- Month 2: Record and edit the videos, and write the accompanying blog posts.
- Month 3: Publish the content and promote it through social media and academic networks.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point (1 month):** Review the content plan and initial scripts to ensure alignment with the learning objectives.
- **Final Check Point (3 months):** Evaluate the engagement metrics (views, comments, shares) of the published content and gather feedback from the audience to refine future content.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Developing Mathematical Models of Active Inference in Biological Systems

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and implement mathematical models of Active Inference in biological systems, such as ant colonies or neural networks, using software tools like MATLAB or Python. The goal is to create practical models that can be used to understand and predict the behavior of these systems.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, mathematical models of Active Inference are often developed in a highly theoretical context, with limited practical application in biological systems. Existing models may lack the complexity and realism needed to accurately predict real-world behaviors.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
The new approach involves using Andrius Kulikauskas's mathematical expertise to develop more realistic and complex models that integrate insights from chemistry, statistical mechanics, and neuroscience. This will be successful because it combines theoretical rigor with practical applicability, allowing for more accurate predictions and better understanding of biological systems.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will benefit researchers and practitioners in fields such as biology, neuroscience, and ecology. By providing more accurate and practical models, it can enhance our understanding of complex biological systems and improve predictive capabilities.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risks include the complexity of developing realistic models, the challenge of integrating multiple disciplinary insights, and the potential for models to be too complex to be computationally feasible.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
Estimated costs include:
- Software licenses (MATLAB or Python): $1,000/year
- Computational resources (if needed): $500/month
- Time and effort: valued at $0 since it leverages existing expertise.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project can be completed within 6-9 months, with the following timeline:
- Months 1-3: Develop the mathematical formulations and initial models.
- Months 4-6: Implement and test the models using software tools.
- Months 7-9: Analyze results, refine models, and prepare a final report or publication.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point (3 months):** Review the initial models and mathematical formulations to ensure they align with the project objectives.
- **Final Check Point (9 months):** Evaluate the performance of the implemented models and gather feedback from peers to refine the models further.

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Building an Interdisciplinary Community and Resource Hub for Active Inference

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Establish an interdisciplinary community and resource hub for Active Inference, bringing together experts and learners from mathematics, neuroscience, philosophy, and other relevant fields. The hub will include educational resources, discussion forums, webinars, and collaborative projects.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, resources for Active Inference are scattered across various academic and professional networks, with limited centralization and coordination. This makes it difficult for newcomers to find comprehensive and integrated resources.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
The new approach involves leveraging Andrius Kulikauskas's leadership role in Math 4 Wisdom to create a centralized hub that integrates educational resources, community engagement, and collaborative projects. This will be successful because it addresses the current fragmentation and provides a single, go-to platform for all things related to Active Inference.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will benefit the entire Active Inference community by providing a unified resource hub that facilitates learning, collaboration, and innovation. It will make a significant difference by fostering a more cohesive and vibrant community, leading to faster progress and more innovative applications of Active Inference.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risks include the challenge of attracting and retaining a diverse community, managing the complexity of interdisciplinary collaboration, and ensuring the sustainability of the hub.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
Estimated costs include:
- Website development and hosting: $5,000
- Marketing and outreach: $2,000/year
- Time and effort: valued at $0 since it leverages existing expertise, but potential for hiring part-time staff or consultants.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project can be completed within 12-18 months, with the following timeline:
- Months 1-3: Plan and develop the website and initial resources.
- Months 4-6: Launch the community hub and start marketing efforts.
- Months 7-12: Build and engage the community through webinars, discussion forums, and collaborative projects.
- Months 13-18: Evaluate the success of the hub and plan for long-term sustainability.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point (6 months):** Review the initial engagement metrics and community feedback to ensure the hub is meeting its objectives.
- **Final Check Point (18 months):** Evaluate the long-term sustainability and impact of the hub, including metrics on user engagement, collaborative projects, and educational resource utilization.
