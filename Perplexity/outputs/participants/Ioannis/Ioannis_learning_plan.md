### Personalized Learning Plan for Ioannis: Active Inference

Given the background of Ioannis, particularly if we consider Ioannis Pratikakis with a strong foundation in computer science and engineering, here is a structured learning plan tailored to his potential interests and expertise.

## Immediate Next Steps (1-2 weeks)

### Specific Resources to Start With
- **Foundational Papers**:
  - Start with Karl Friston's seminal papers on Active Inference, such as "The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory?".
  - Access these papers through academic databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, or the researcher's personal website.
- **Introductory Tutorials**:
  - Watch introductory videos or webinars on Active Inference. For example, the "Active Inference Tutorial" by the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging.

### Initial Learning Objectives
- Understand the basic principles of Active Inference, including the free-energy principle and its application in decision-making and perception.
- Familiarize yourself with the key terms and concepts.

### Concrete Actions to Take
- Read the introductory papers and take notes on the key concepts.
- Watch the tutorials and summarize the main points.
- Join online forums or discussion groups related to Active Inference to ask initial questions and get a feel for the community.

## Short-Term Goals (1-3 months)

### Key Concepts to Master
- **Free-Energy Principle**: Understand how this principle underlies Active Inference.
- **Bayesian Inference**: Learn about the Bayesian framework and how it is applied in Active Inference.
- **Predictive Coding**: Understand the role of predictive coding in perception and action.

### Practical Exercises or Projects
- **Simulations**: Use software tools like MATLAB or Python libraries (e.g., `spm` for MATLAB) to simulate simple Active Inference models.
  - Example: Simulate a basic perceptual inference task using predictive coding.
- **Case Studies**: Analyze case studies where Active Inference has been applied, such as in robotics or neuroscience.

### Recommended Study Materials
- **Books**:
  - "The Free-Energy Principle: A Unified Theory of the Brain?" by Karl Friston.
  - "Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Action" by Thomas Parr and Karl Friston.
- **Online Courses**:
  - Look for courses on platforms like Coursera, edX, or Udemy that cover Bayesian inference, predictive coding, and Active Inference.

### Community Engagement Opportunities
- **Conferences and Workshops**: Register for upcoming conferences or workshops focused on Active Inference, such as those organized by the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging.
- **Online Forums**: Participate in forums like Reddit's r/ActiveInference or specialized groups on LinkedIn.

## Medium-Term Development (3-6 months)

### Advanced Topics to Explore
- **Active Inference in Robotics**: Study how Active Inference can be integrated into robotic systems for adaptive behavior and decision-making.
  - Example: Read about the application of Active Inference in semantic mapping for mobile robots[4].
