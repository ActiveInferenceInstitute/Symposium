### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Active Inference in Image Processing

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and implement a simple Active Inference model to enhance image recognition or segmentation tasks, leveraging the participant's background in image processing.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, image recognition and segmentation tasks are often performed using deep learning models such as CNNs. However, these models can be data-intensive and may not always handle uncertainty or dynamic environments well. Active Inference offers a framework that integrates perception, learning, and action under a unified probabilistic model, which can potentially improve robustness and adaptability in image processing tasks.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
The new approach involves integrating Active Inference principles into image processing by using generative models that minimize free energy. This method can handle uncertainty and adapt to changing environments more effectively than traditional deep learning models. By using variational free energy to drive the agent towards preferred states, the model can make more informed decisions about image features and segments.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project could significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of image recognition and segmentation systems, particularly in applications where data is limited or noisy. This could have practical implications in fields like medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, and surveillance.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Technical Challenges**: Integrating Active Inference with existing image processing pipelines could be complex.
- **Performance**: The new approach might not outperform current state-of-the-art deep learning models initially.
- **Resource Intensive**: Computationally intensive tasks may require significant resources.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project will primarily require computational resources (e.g., GPU time) and access to relevant datasets. Since the participant is likely affiliated with a university, these resources might be available at minimal cost.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- **Literature Review**: 1 week
- **Model Implementation**: 2-3 weeks
- **Testing and Evaluation**: 2-3 weeks
Total duration: Approximately 6-8 weeks.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Week 2**: Review of literature and understanding of Active Inference principles.
- **Week 5**: Initial implementation of the Active Inference model in a simple image processing task.
- **Week 8**: Final evaluation and comparison with traditional deep learning models.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Active Inference in Educational Technology

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop an adaptive learning environment that integrates Active Inference principles to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes, leveraging the participant's background in educational technology.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current adaptive learning systems often use reinforcement learning or other machine learning techniques to personalize learning paths. However, these systems may not fully capture the dynamic and uncertain nature of student learning. Active Inference offers a more holistic approach by integrating perception, learning, and action, which can better model student behavior and adapt to their needs.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
The new approach involves using Active Inference to create an adaptive learning environment where the system continuously updates its beliefs about the student's knowledge and preferences. This is achieved through variational free energy minimization, allowing the system to balance exploration and exploitation effectively. The system will also incorporate episodic memory modules to better track student progress and adjust the learning path accordingly.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project could lead to more effective and engaging adaptive learning systems, improving student outcomes and reducing the gap in educational achievement. This could have significant implications for educational institutions and policymakers.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Complexity**: Integrating Active Inference into an educational platform can be complex and require significant development time.
- **User Acceptance**: Students and teachers might need training to use the new system effectively.
- **Scalability**: The system may face challenges when scaled to larger student populations.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project will require resources for development, testing, and potentially user studies. Costs could include software development tools, computational resources, and possibly funding for user studies.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- **Literature Review and Planning**: 2-3 weeks
- **System Design and Implementation**: 8-12 weeks
- **Testing and Evaluation**: 4-6 weeks
Total duration: Approximately 14-21 weeks.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Week 5**: Completion of system design and initial implementation.
- **Week 12**: Pilot testing with a small group of students.
- **Week 20**: Final evaluation and comparison with existing adaptive learning systems.

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Multi-Agent Active Inference for Human-Computer Interaction

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a multi-agent system using Active Inference principles to enhance human-computer interaction, particularly in collaborative and dynamic environments, leveraging the participant's background in human-computer interaction.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current human-computer interaction systems often rely on static models or simple reinforcement learning algorithms to manage user interactions. However, these models do not fully capture the complexity and dynamism of human behavior, especially in collaborative settings. Active Inference offers a more comprehensive framework that can model and adapt to the uncertain and dynamic nature of human interactions.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
The new approach involves developing a multi-agent system where each agent uses Active Inference to model and predict the behavior of other agents (human or machine) in the environment. This will be achieved by integrating deep learning techniques with Active Inference to handle complex state spaces and uncertainties. The system will also incorporate mechanisms for collective exploration and decision-making, ensuring that the agents can adapt and learn from each other.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project could revolutionize human-computer interaction by creating more adaptive, responsive, and collaborative systems. This could have profound implications for fields such as virtual reality, collaborative work environments, and social robots.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Complexity**: Developing a multi-agent system with Active Inference is highly complex and requires significant expertise.
- **Scalability**: The system may face scalability issues when dealing with large numbers of agents.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Ensuring the system respects user privacy and ethical guidelines could be challenging.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project will require substantial resources, including advanced computational infrastructure, potential funding for a research team, and access to specialized software tools.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- **Literature Review and Planning**: 4-6 weeks
- **System Design and Implementation**: 20-30 weeks
- **Testing and Evaluation**: 8-12 weeks
Total duration: Approximately 32-48 weeks.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Week 10**: Completion of system design and initial implementation of single-agent Active Inference.
- **Week 25**: Implementation of multi-agent interactions and preliminary testing.
- **Week 40**: Final evaluation and comparison with existing human-computer interaction systems.

Each of these proposals is tailored to leverage Ioannis's background and interests while providing a structured path for learning and applying Active Inference principles.
