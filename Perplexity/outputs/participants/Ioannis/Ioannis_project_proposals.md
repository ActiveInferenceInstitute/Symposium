### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Active Inference Simulation in Simple Environments

**1. What are you trying to do?**
Create a simple simulation to demonstrate the basic principles of Active Inference in a controlled environment.

**2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**
Currently, Active Inference simulations are often complex and require a deep understanding of the underlying mathematics. However, simple simulations are limited in their ability to illustrate the full potential of Active Inference, particularly in real-world scenarios.

**3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?**
This project will use Python libraries (e.g., `numpy`, `scipy`) to simulate an Active Inference agent in a simple grid-world environment. The approach will be new in that it will:
- Use a simplified version of the free-energy principle to make the simulation more accessible.
- Implement predictive coding to demonstrate how the agent perceives and acts in the environment.
- Utilize Monte Carlo methods for efficient simulation, as described in the literature[2].

**4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?**
This project will help Ioannis gain a practical understanding of Active Inference, which can be applied to more complex projects later. It will also serve as a teaching tool for others interested in the field.

**5. What are the risks?**
The main risk is the simplicity of the environment, which might not fully capture the complexities of real-world scenarios. Additionally, there could be challenges in implementing the free-energy principle and predictive coding accurately.

**6. How much will it cost?**
This project will not incur significant costs, as it will rely on open-source libraries and existing computational resources.

**7. How long will it take?**
This project is expected to take approximately 1-2 weeks to complete, depending on the depth of the simulation and the complexity of the environment.

**8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?**
- **Mid-term Check Point:** Successfully implement the basic simulation framework within the first week.
- **Final Check Point:** Complete the simulation and analyze the results to ensure they align with the theoretical expectations of Active Inference.

**Potential Collaborators or Resources:**
- **Literature:** Karl Friston's papers and the Active Inference Institute's resources[5].
- **Software Tools:** Python libraries such as `numpy` and `scipy`.
- **Community:** Active Inference forums and discussion groups.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with Deep Learning for Semantic Segmentation

**1. What are you trying to do?**
Develop an Active Inference framework integrated with deep learning to enhance the performance of semantic segmentation models.

**2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**
Current semantic segmentation models rely heavily on deep learning architectures but lack the adaptive and probabilistic nature of Active Inference. This limits their ability to handle uncertain or dynamic environments.

**3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?**
This project will integrate Active Inference with deep learning models using:
- **Prioritised Replay Buffer (PRB):** To improve the generative model's quality, as proposed in the literature[1].
- **Temporal Episodic Memory (TEM):** To enhance the agent's perception and action planning[1].
- **Deep Active Inference Agents:** Utilizing Monte Carlo methods and top-down modulation of precision over state transitions to improve learning efficiency[2].

**4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?**
This project will improve the performance and adaptability of semantic segmentation models, particularly in real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles or medical imaging.

**5. What are the risks?**
The main risks include the complexity of integrating Active Inference with deep learning architectures and the potential for increased computational overhead.

**6. How much will it cost?**
This project may require access to computational resources such as GPUs, which could incur some costs. However, the primary resources will be existing deep learning frameworks and Active Inference libraries.

**7. How long will it take?**
This project is expected to take approximately 3-6 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the integration and the performance of the models.

**8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?**
- **Mid-term Check Point:** Successfully integrate the PRB and TEM modules with the deep learning framework within the first 3 months.
- **Final Check Point:** Evaluate the performance of the integrated model on benchmark datasets and compare it with traditional deep learning models.

**Potential Collaborators or Resources:**

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Active Inference in Robotic Systems for Adaptive Behavior

**1. What are you trying to do?**
Develop an Active Inference-based framework for robotic systems to enable adaptive behavior and decision-making in complex environments.

**2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**
Current robotic systems often rely on traditional reinforcement learning or model-based control methods, which can be inflexible and fail to adapt well to dynamic or uncertain environments.

**3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?**
This project will implement Active Inference in robotic systems by:
- **Using Bayesian Inference:** To model the environment and the robot's internal state, allowing for probabilistic reasoning and adaptive behavior[3].
- **Integrating Predictive Coding:** To enhance perception and action planning, enabling the robot to better navigate and interact with its environment[2].
- **Employing Deep Active Inference Agents:** Utilizing Monte Carlo methods and top-down modulation of precision over state transitions to improve learning efficiency and adaptability[2].

**4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?**
This project will significantly enhance the capabilities of robotic systems, making them more adaptive and efficient in real-world applications such as search and rescue, autonomous vehicles, and industrial robotics.

**5. What are the risks?**
The main risks include the complexity of integrating Active Inference with robotic systems, potential computational overhead, and the need for extensive testing and validation in various environments.

**6. How much will it cost?**
This project may require significant resources, including robotic hardware, computational infrastructure, and possibly funding for research personnel.

**7. How long will it take?**
This project is expected to take approximately 1-2 years to complete, depending on the complexity of the integration, the development of new algorithms, and the thorough testing required.
