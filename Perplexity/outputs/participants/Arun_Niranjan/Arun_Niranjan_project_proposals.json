  "content": "### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Enhancing the pymdp Cookbook with Advanced POMDP Examples\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nUpdate and expand the `pymdp-cookbook` repository with advanced examples of Partially-Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to help users better understand and apply active inference in complex scenarios.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrently, the `pymdp-cookbook` provides basic examples of active inference using `pymdp`. However, these examples are limited in scope and do not cover advanced POMDP scenarios, such as multi-modal transitions and continuous action spaces. This limits the usability of the library for more complex real-world applications.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThe new approach involves creating detailed examples and tutorials that demonstrate how to set up and solve advanced POMDP problems using `pymdp`. This will include simulations of multi-modal transitions, continuous action spaces, and integration with reinforcement learning methods. The success of this approach is ensured by leveraging Arun Niranjan's expertise in maintaining the `pymdp-cookbook` and his familiarity with active inference concepts.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nThe success of this project will make a significant difference to researchers and practitioners who use `pymdp` for active inference. It will provide them with practical, advanced examples that can be applied to real-world problems, enhancing the library's usability and the community's understanding of active inference.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\nThe main risk is the potential complexity of the examples, which could make them difficult to follow or implement. However, this can be mitigated by thorough documentation and step-by-step tutorials.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThis project will not incur significant costs, as it primarily involves updating existing resources and creating new examples using the `pymdp` library.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\nThe project is expected to take 1-2 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the examples and the depth of documentation required.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Mid-term Checkpoint (1 month):** Completion of the initial set of advanced POMDP examples.\n- **Final Checkpoint (2 months):** Full integration of the new examples into the `pymdp-cookbook`, along with comprehensive documentation and user feedback.\n\n### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with Reinforcement Learning for Task Specification\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nDevelop and implement a framework that integrates active inference with reinforcement learning to aid task specification in sequential decision-making problems.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrently, active inference and reinforcement learning are often used separately. Active inference is used for perception and action under uncertainty, while reinforcement learning is used for sequential decision-making. However, integrating these two frameworks can provide a more robust and adaptive decision-making system. The current practice lacks a clear methodology for combining these approaches effectively.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThe new approach involves using `pymdp` to implement active inference models that can specify tasks and integrate these with reinforcement learning frameworks (e.g., OpenAIGym). This integration will enable the agent to learn and adapt to new tasks more efficiently by leveraging the strengths of both active inference and reinforcement learning. The success of this approach is supported by the theoretical foundations of active inference and the practical applications of reinforcement learning.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nThe success of this project will significantly impact researchers and practitioners in the fields of artificial intelligence, robotics, and cognitive neuroscience. It will provide a novel framework for adaptive decision-making that can be applied in various domains, such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and human-computer interaction.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\nThe main risks include the complexity of integrating two different frameworks and the potential for increased computational overhead. However, these risks can be managed by careful design and optimization of the integration methodology.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThis project will not incur significant costs beyond computational resources and time. It will leverage existing libraries and frameworks, reducing the need for additional funding.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\nThe project is expected to take 3-6 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the integration and the need for testing and validation.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Mid-term Checkpoint (3 months):** Completion of the initial integration of active inference and reinforcement learning frameworks.\n- **Final Checkpoint (6 months):** Full implementation and testing of the integrated framework, along with a documented case study demonstrating its effectiveness.\n\n### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Applying Active Inference to Real-World Engineering Problems and Cognitive Neuroscience\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nApply active inference to real-world engineering problems and cognitive neuroscience applications, demonstrating its practical and theoretical impact.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrently, active inference is primarily used in theoretical and simulation-based studies. However, its application in real-world engineering problems and cognitive neuroscience is limited due to the complexity of modeling real-world systems and the lack of empirical validation. The current practice is often constrained by the simplicity of the models used and the lack of interdisciplinary collaboration.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThe new approach involves collaborating with engineers and cognitive neuroscientists to apply active inference to real-world problems. This includes modeling complex system control, decision-making under uncertainty, and understanding human or animal behavior. The success of this approach is ensured by leveraging Arun Niranjan's expertise in active inference, the practical applications of the `pymdp` library, and the interdisciplinary collaboration with experts in engineering and cognitive neuroscience.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nThe success of this project will make a significant impact on various fields, including engineering, cognitive neuroscience, and psychopathology. It will provide robust and adaptive models for real-world problems, enhancing our understanding of complex systems and human behavior.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\nThe main risks include the complexity of modeling real-world systems, the need for significant data collection and validation, and the potential for interdisciplinary collaboration challenges. However, these risks can be managed through careful planning, robust methodology, and collaborative efforts.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThis project may incur costs related to data collection, computational resources, and potential travel or collaboration expenses. However, these costs can be managed through grants, collaborations with institutions, or industry partnerships.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\nThe project is expected to take 6-12 months to complete, depending on the scope of the applications and the complexity of the collaborations involved.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Mid-term Checkpoint (6 months):** Completion of the initial modeling and simulation phase, along with preliminary results from the real-world applications.\n- **Final Checkpoint (12 months):** Full implementation, testing, and validation of the active inference models in real-world engineering problems and cognitive neuroscience applications, along with published research papers and case studies demonstrating the impact of the project.",
