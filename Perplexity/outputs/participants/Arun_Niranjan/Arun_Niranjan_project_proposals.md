### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Active Inference in Medical Diagnosis

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and implement a simple active inference model to predict patient behavior in medical diagnosis scenarios, using the `pymdp` library.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, medical diagnosis often relies on traditional statistical models and clinical judgment. However, these methods can be limited by their inability to account for the dynamic and uncertain nature of patient behavior and medical outcomes. Existing models may not fully incorporate the patient's and clinician's beliefs and actions in a unified framework.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project uses active inference to model the decision-making process in medical diagnosis, integrating both the clinician's and patient's perspectives. By setting up a generative model using `pymdp`, we can simulate how beliefs about patient health states evolve over time and how actions (e.g., treatments) affect these beliefs. This approach is new because it leverages the free-energy principle to optimize decision-making under uncertainty, potentially leading to more accurate and personalized diagnoses.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project could significantly impact medical practice by providing a more robust and adaptive framework for diagnosis. Clinicians and patients would benefit from more accurate predictions and personalized treatment plans, leading to improved health outcomes.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of modeling real-world medical scenarios, the need for high-quality data, and the potential for overfitting or misinterpretation of model results.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project is expected to be low-cost, primarily requiring computational resources and access to the `pymdp` library, which is open-source.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take about 1-2 months, given the participant's existing familiarity with `pymdp` and active inference.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: After 4 weeks, review the initial model setup and preliminary results to ensure the generative model is correctly capturing the dynamics of patient health states.
- **Final Check Point**: After 8 weeks, evaluate the performance of the active inference model against traditional diagnostic methods and present the findings.

**Specific Resources and Collaborators:**
- Utilize the `pymdp` library and its documentation.
- Collaborate with clinicians and researchers from the UCL Centre For Advanced Biomedical Imaging.
- Engage with the active inference community through GitHub forums and discussions.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with Deep Learning for Stochastic Dynamics

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a framework that integrates active inference with deep learning methods to learn stochastic dynamics models, particularly focusing on continuous action spaces.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, active inference models often rely on predefined dynamics models. However, these models can be overly simplistic and fail to capture the complexity of real-world scenarios. Deep learning methods offer a way to learn more complex dynamics, but integrating these with active inference is a challenging task.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project combines the `pymdp` library with deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch) to learn stochastic dynamics models. By using neural networks to learn the dynamics, the model can handle more complex and continuous action spaces, enhancing the applicability of active inference in real-world problems. This approach leverages the strengths of both active inference and deep learning, potentially leading to more accurate and robust models.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This integration could significantly expand the scope of active inference applications, particularly in fields like robotics, control theory, and cognitive neuroscience. It would enable more realistic modeling of complex systems and better decision-making under uncertainty.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the technical challenges of integrating two different modeling paradigms, the need for large datasets, and the potential for overfitting or instability in the learned models.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project will require access to computational resources capable of handling deep learning computations, which may involve some costs, but the primary tools (e.g., `pymdp`, TensorFlow) are open-source.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take about 3-6 months, given the complexity of integrating deep learning with active inference.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: After 6 weeks, evaluate the initial integration of deep learning with the `pymdp` library to ensure that the dynamics models are being learned correctly.
- **Final Check Point**: After 12 weeks, assess the performance of the integrated model on a set of benchmark tasks and compare it with traditional active inference models.

**Specific Resources and Collaborators:**
- Utilize the `pymdp` library and deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- Collaborate with researchers from the UT Austin AI Lab or similar institutions.
- Engage with workshops and webinars focused on the intersection of active inference and deep learning.

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Active Inference in Social Cognition and Group Decision-Making

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and implement an active inference model to study social cognition and group decision-making processes, focusing on how individuals and groups adapt and make decisions in social contexts.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current models of social cognition and group decision-making often rely on simplistic assumptions about human behavior and do not fully account for the dynamic and interactive nature of social interactions. Existing models may not capture the complexities of belief updating and action selection in social contexts.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project uses active inference to model social cognition and group decision-making, incorporating the free-energy principle to understand how individuals and groups update their beliefs and make decisions. By setting up a generative model that includes social interactions and group dynamics, we can simulate how social contexts influence decision-making processes. This approach is new because it integrates active inference with social cognition theories, potentially offering a more comprehensive and adaptive framework for understanding social behavior.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project could revolutionize the field of social cognition by providing a more robust and adaptive framework for understanding group decision-making. It would be valuable for fields such as psychology, sociology, and political science, and could inform policies and interventions aimed at improving group decision-making processes.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of modeling social interactions, the need for high-quality data on social behavior, and the potential for oversimplification or misinterpretation of the model results.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project will require significant computational resources and potentially access to specialized data collection tools or surveys, which could involve substantial costs.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take about 6-12 months, given the complexity of the task and the need for extensive data collection and model validation.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: After 3 months, review the initial model setup and preliminary results to ensure that the generative model is correctly capturing the dynamics of social interactions.
- **Final Check Point**: After 9 months, evaluate the performance of the active inference model against traditional models of social cognition and group decision-making, and present the findings in a research paper or conference.

**Specific Resources and Collaborators:**
- Utilize the `pymdp` library and social cognition theories.
- Collaborate with researchers from psychology, sociology, and political science departments.
- Engage with workshops and conferences focused on social cognition and group decision-making.
