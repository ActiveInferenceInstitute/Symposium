### Personalized Learning Plan for Arun Niranjan on Active Inference

#### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **pymdp Documentation and Tutorials**: Review the latest documentation and tutorials for the `pymdp` library to ensure you are up-to-date with all the features and updates[3][5].
- **Active Inference Basics**: Refresh your understanding of the foundational concepts of active inference, including Bayesian inference, partially-observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), and the integration of perception, action, and learning. A good starting point is the pymdp documentation and associated research papers[3][5].

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the latest updates and features in the `pymdp` library.
- Reinforce the basics of active inference and its application in discrete state spaces.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Go through the `pymdp-cookbook` repository on GitHub to update your examples and ensure they reflect the latest library features.
- Read key papers such as "Active inference is an account of cognition and behavior in complex systems" to reinforce your understanding of the theoretical underpinnings[5].

#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Advanced POMDPs**: Delve deeper into advanced POMDP models, including stochastic dynamics approximation with conditional variational inference[2].
- **Integration with Reinforcement Learning**: Study the intersection of planning and learning, particularly model-based reinforcement learning and its combination with active inference[2].

**Practical Exercises or Projects:**
- **Simulate Complex Scenarios**: Use `pymdp` to simulate complex scenarios involving multi-modal transitions and continuous action spaces, as described in the TU Delft dissertation on the intersection of planning and learning[2].
- **Integrate with Reinforcement Learning**: Implement examples where active inference is used to aid task specification in sequential decision-making problems, such as those outlined in the UT Austin research[1].

**Recommended Study Materials:**
- **TU Delft Dissertation**: Read the dissertation on "The Intersection of Planning and Learning" to get a comprehensive view of how planning and learning can be combined[2].
- **UT Austin Research Papers**: Study papers from the UT Austin machine learning research group, particularly those related to natural language feedback in reinforcement learning and task specification[1].

**Community Engagement Opportunities:**
- **Attend Workshops and Conferences**: Look for upcoming workshops and conferences on active inference, reinforcement learning, and cognitive neuroscience. Participate in events like the Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL) or the Annual Conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)[1][2].
- **Engage on Forums**: Join forums and discussion groups related to active inference, such as those on GitHub or research community platforms, to stay updated and share knowledge.

#### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)

**Advanced Topics to Explore:**
- **Control Theory Applications**: Explore how active inference is applied in control theory, including the work by Baioumy et al. and Baltieri & Buckley[5].
