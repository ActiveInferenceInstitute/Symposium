### Personalized Learning Plan for Arun Niranjan on Active Inference

#### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **pymdp Documentation and Tutorials**: Start by reviewing the latest documentation and tutorials provided by the `pymdp` library. This will ensure you are updated with the latest features and best practices[2][5].
  - Link: [pymdp Documentation](https://github.com/arun-niranjan/infer-actively/pymdp)
- **Key Academic Papers**: Read recent papers by Karl Friston and other key figures in the field to deepen your understanding of the theoretical foundations of active inference.
  - Suggested Papers:
    - Friston, K., et al. (2012). "Active inference and agency: optimal control of non-conservative systems." *Biological Cybernetics*, 106(8), 411-426.
    - Friston, K. (2010). "The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory?" *Nature Reviews Neuroscience*, 11(2), 127-138.

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Refresh understanding of the theoretical foundations of active inference.
- Familiarize yourself with the latest updates and features in the `pymdp` library.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Complete the tutorials in the `pymdp-cookbook` repository to ensure proficiency in setting up and running active inference models.
- Implement a simple active inference model using `pymdp` to reinforce your understanding.

#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Advanced POMDP Models**: Delve deeper into complex POMDP models, including those with stochastic dynamics and continuous action spaces.
