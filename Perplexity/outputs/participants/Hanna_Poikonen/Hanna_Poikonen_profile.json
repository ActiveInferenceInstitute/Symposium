Here are some key aspects of her expertise and experience:\n\n- **Education and Research**: Dr. Poikonen has a doctoral degree from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Helsinki, with a focus on cortical oscillations in professional dancers, musicians, and novices. She has also conducted postdoctoral training at ETH Zurich and is currently a guest researcher at \u00d6rebro University Hospital in Sweden[4][5].\n\n- **Interdisciplinary Background**: Her background combines biomedical engineering, neuroscience, and dance, along with postgraduate studies in art therapy and extensive experience in contemporary dance and martial arts[4][5].\n\n- **Teaching and Community Engagement**: Since 2018, she has been teaching the WiseMotion method globally, which integrates neuroscience, creative movement, and meditation. This method is targeted at educators, creative professionals, healthcare professionals, and individuals with brain-related illnesses[4][5].\n\nGiven her broad and interdisciplinary background, Dr. Poikonen brings a unique perspective to the fields of neuroscience, movement, and cognition.\n\n### Active Inference Journey: Current Understanding and Application Stage\n\nThere is no explicit information provided about Dr. Hanna Poikonen's current understanding or application of Active Inference in her work. Active Inference is a theoretical framework within neuroscience and cognitive science that explains how agents (such as humans) make decisions and perceive the world by minimizing surprise and maintaining a stable internal state.\n\nWithout specific details, it is uncertain whether Dr. Poikonen has incorporated Active Inference into her research or teaching methods. However, her work on embodied cognition, math expertise, and the influence of creative movement on brain function could potentially intersect with concepts related to Active Inference, especially in terms of how movement and cognition are integrated and how the brain processes sensory information.\n\n### Learning Path: Specific Needs and Potential Resources\n\nTo integrate Active Inference into her work, Dr. Poikonen might need:\n\n- **Theoretical Foundations**: Resources such as academic papers, workshops, or courses that delve into the theoretical underpinnings of Active Inference. Key researchers in the field, such as Karl Friston, could be valuable resources[Note: This is a general suggestion, as specific resources are not provided].\n\n- **Practical Applications**: Case studies or empirical research that demonstrate the application of Active Inference in similar fields, such as motor control, cognitive development, or rehabilitation. This could help her understand how to apply these principles in her WiseMotion method.\n\n- **Interdisciplinary Dialogue**: Engaging with researchers and practitioners who are already applying Active Inference in various fields could provide valuable insights and practical examples.\n\nGiven her current affiliations and projects, collaborating with researchers at ETH Zurich or \u00d6rebro University Hospital who have expertise in cognitive neuroscience or computational models of brain function could also be beneficial.\n\n### Collaboration Potential: Possible Synergies\n\nDr. Poikonen's unique blend of neuroscience, dance, and creative movement offers several potential synergies:\n\n- **Interdisciplinary Research**: Her collaboration with researchers from diverse backgrounds (e.g., cognitive neuroscience, psychology, education) could enrich the understanding of how Active Inference principles can be applied in creative and rehabilitative contexts.\n\n- **Practical Applications**: Her WiseMotion method could serve as a practical platform to test and apply theories of Active Inference, particularly in the realms of motor control, cognition, and emotional regulation.\n\n- **Education and Training**: Her experience in teaching globally could help disseminate knowledge about Active Inference to a wide range of professionals and individuals, facilitating broader adoption and application.\n\n### Challenges & Opportunities: Personal and Field-Wide Perspectives\n\n#### Personal Challenges\n- **Integration of New Theories**: Incorporating Active Inference into her existing body of work might require significant theoretical and practical adjustments. There could be a learning curve in understanding and applying these new concepts effectively.\n- **Balancing Multiple Roles**: Managing her roles as a researcher, educator, and community founder might present challenges in dedicating the necessary time and resources to fully explore and integrate Active Inference.\n\n#### Field-Wide Challenges\n- **Complexity of Human Behavior**: Applying Active Inference to complex behaviors like creative movement and cognition can be challenging due to the inherent variability and subjectivity of human experiences.\n- **Empirical Validation**: There may be a need for more empirical studies to validate the application of Active Inference in rehabilitation and creative movement contexts, which could be time-consuming and resource-intensive.\n\n#### Opportunities\n- **Innovative Applications**: Integrating Active Inference into her work could lead to innovative methods in rehabilitation, education, and cognitive enhancement, potentially offering new therapeutic approaches.\n- **Interdisciplinary Advancements**: The intersection of Active Inference with her existing expertise could contribute significantly to the broader understanding of embodied cognition and the neural basis of creative movement.\n- **Broader Impact**: By applying Active Inference principles, Dr. Poikonen\u2019s WiseMotion method could have a more profound impact on the well-being and cognitive function of her participants, contributing to both personal and societal health.\n\nIn summary, while there is potential for Dr. Poikonen to engage with Active Inference, the current information does not provide a clear indication of her current involvement or the specific steps she might take to integrate it into her work. However, her background and current projects suggest a fertile ground for such integration.",
