### Detailed Learning Plan for Dr. Hanna Poikonen to Integrate Active Inference

#### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Academic Papers:**
  - Start with foundational papers by Karl Friston, such as "The Free-Energy Principle: A Unified Brain Theory?".
  - Read introductory articles on Active Inference, like "Active Inference: A Process Theory" by Friston et al..

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the core principles of Active Inference.
- Recognize how Active Inference relates to her current work in neuroscience, movement, and cognition.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Dedicate 2 hours daily for the next two weeks to read and annotate the foundational papers.
- Create a concept map or notes outlining the key concepts and how they might relate to her WiseMotion method.
- Join online forums or discussion groups focused on Active Inference to get a sense of the community and current discussions.

#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Surprise Minimization:** Understand how agents minimize surprise to maintain a stable internal state.
- **Predictive Coding:** Learn about the role of predictive coding in sensory processing and motor control.
- **Bayesian Inference:** Familiarize yourself with Bayesian inference and its application in Active Inference.

**Practical Exercises or Projects:**
- **Case Studies:** Analyze case studies where Active Inference has been applied in motor control, cognitive development, or rehabilitation. For example, look into studies on the application of Active Inference in motor learning and recovery.
- **Simulations:** Use software tools like MATLAB or Python libraries (e.g., `pyinfer`) to simulate simple Active Inference models and observe how they work.

**Recommended Study Materials:**
- **Courses:**
  - Enroll in online courses or workshops that cover Active Inference, such as those offered by the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging or similar institutions.
  - Watch video lectures by Karl Friston and other key researchers in the field.
- **Books:**
  - Read "The Free-Energy Principle: A Rough Guide to the Brain?" by Karl Friston.

**Community Engagement Opportunities:**
- **Conferences and Workshops:** Attend or participate in webinars, conferences, or workshops focused on Active Inference. For example, the annual Computational and Systems Neuroscience (COSYNE) conference.
- **Collaborations:** Reach out to researchers at ETH Zurich or Ã–rebro University Hospital who have expertise in cognitive neuroscience or computational models of brain function to discuss potential collaborations.

#### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)

**Advanced Topics to Explore:**
- **Active Inference in Embodied Cognition:** Dive deeper into how Active Inference can explain embodied cognition and the integration of sensory and motor processes.
- **Neural Mechanisms:** Study the neural mechanisms underlying Active Inference, including the role of predictive coding and Bayesian inference in brain regions.

**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**
- **Interdisciplinary Projects:** Collaborate with researchers from diverse backgrounds to apply Active Inference principles to creative movement and cognition. This could involve projects integrating dance, music, and cognitive training.
- **Empirical Studies:** Design and conduct empirical studies to validate the application of Active Inference in rehabilitation and creative movement contexts.

**Application Projects in Their Domain:**
- **WiseMotion Integration:** Integrate Active Inference principles into the WiseMotion method. This could involve designing new exercises or protocols that explicitly minimize surprise and optimize predictive coding.
- **Case Studies and Pilot Projects:** Conduct pilot projects or case studies applying Active Inference in real-world settings, such as in dance therapy or cognitive rehabilitation programs.

**Skill-Building Activities:**
- **Programming Skills:** Develop programming skills in MATLAB or Python to implement and simulate Active Inference models.
