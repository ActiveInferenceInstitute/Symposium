### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Applying Active Inference to Anxiety Disorders

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Articulate how Active Inference can be applied to understand and treat anxiety disorders, and develop a preliminary case study to illustrate this application.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, anxiety disorders are treated using a variety of therapeutic approaches, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacological interventions. However, these methods often lack a unified theoretical framework that explains the underlying mechanisms of anxiety. The limits of current practice include the lack of a comprehensive model that integrates both the psychological and neurobiological aspects of anxiety.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project applies the Active Inference framework to anxiety disorders, leveraging the free energy principle to explain how individuals with anxiety might be trying to minimize prediction error in their environment. By using Bayesian inference and the concept of narrative fallacy, this approach offers a new perspective on the maintenance and treatment of anxiety. It will be successful because it provides a theoretically grounded model that can be tested and validated clinically.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will be valuable to clinicians and researchers working on anxiety disorders. By providing a clear, theoretically-driven framework, it can enhance treatment outcomes and offer new therapeutic strategies. Patients will benefit from more targeted and effective treatments.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risk is the complexity of integrating Active Inference into clinical practice, which may require additional training and resources. There is also the risk that the theoretical model may not translate well into practical clinical applications.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The cost will be minimal, primarily involving time and resources to read and apply relevant literature, and potentially some software or online course fees.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project can be completed within 1-3 months, depending on the depth of the case study and the amount of time devoted to it each week.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Weekly Reflections**: Review the progress in understanding Active Inference and its application to anxiety disorders.
- **Monthly Review**: Assess the preliminary case study and gather feedback from peers or mentors.
- **Final Case Study**: Complete and present the case study, evaluating its success and areas for improvement.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with Neuropsychoanalysis

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a comprehensive framework that integrates Active Inference with neuropsychoanalytic theories and practices, and apply this framework to a specific clinical condition such as trauma.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, neuropsychoanalysis and Active Inference are distinct fields with some overlap but no clear integration. Neuropsychoanalysis focuses on bridging neuroscience and psychoanalysis, while Active Inference provides a Bayesian framework for understanding perception and action. The limits of current practice include the lack of a unified model that combines these two approaches.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project integrates the free energy principle of Active Inference with the theoretical foundations of neuropsychoanalysis. By combining these frameworks, it aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms underlying trauma. It will be successful because it leverages the strengths of both theories to offer a more holistic approach to diagnosis and treatment.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will be valuable to clinicians, researchers, and patients involved in trauma treatment. It can provide new therapeutic strategies and enhance the understanding of trauma mechanisms, leading to better treatment outcomes.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risk is the complexity of integrating two complex theoretical frameworks. There is also the risk that the integration may not yield practical clinical benefits.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The cost will involve time, resources for literature and software, and potentially collaboration fees or workshop participation costs.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project can be completed within 3-6 months, depending on the depth of integration and the amount of time devoted to it each week.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Collaboration Meetings**: Hold regular meetings with collaborators from both neuropsychoanalysis and Active Inference backgrounds to review progress.
- **Draft Framework**: Develop a preliminary framework integrating Active Inference and neuropsychoanalysis within 3 months.
- **Case Study Application**: Apply the framework to a specific case study on trauma within 6 months and evaluate its effectiveness.

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing a Comprehensive Active Inference Model for Neurodiverse Conditions

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a comprehensive Active Inference model that explains the symptomatology and treatment of neurodiverse conditions such as Tourette's Syndrome (TS), autism, and ADHD, and validate this model through clinical studies.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, neurodiverse conditions are treated with a variety of therapeutic approaches, but there is no unified theoretical framework that explains the underlying mechanisms. The limits of current practice include the lack of a comprehensive model that integrates both the psychological and neurobiological aspects of these conditions.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project applies the Active Inference framework to neurodiverse conditions, leveraging the free energy principle to explain how individuals with these conditions might be trying to minimize prediction error in their environment. By using Bayesian inference and the concept of narrative fallacy, this approach offers a new perspective on the maintenance and treatment of these conditions. It will be successful because it provides a theoretically grounded model that can be tested and validated clinically, potentially leading to more targeted and effective treatments.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will be valuable to clinicians, researchers, and patients involved in the treatment of neurodiverse conditions. It can provide new therapeutic strategies and enhance the understanding of these conditions, leading to better treatment outcomes and improved quality of life for patients.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risks include the complexity of the project, the need for extensive clinical validation, and the potential that the theoretical model may not translate well into practical clinical applications.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The cost will be significant, involving funding for research personnel, software, and clinical studies. Potential costs include:
- Research personnel salaries
- Software and computational resources
- Clinical study expenses

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project can take 1-2 years to complete, depending on the scope of the clinical studies and the amount of time devoted to it each week.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Literature Review**: Complete a comprehensive literature review on Active Inference and neurodiverse conditions within 3 months.
- **Preliminary Model Development**: Develop a preliminary Active Inference model for neurodiverse conditions within 6 months.
- **Clinical Study Design**: Design and initiate clinical studies to validate the model within 9 months.
- **Final Model Validation**: Complete and publish the clinical studies validating the model within 1-2 years.
- **Dissemination**: Present the findings at conferences and publish in academic journals to disseminate the results widely.
