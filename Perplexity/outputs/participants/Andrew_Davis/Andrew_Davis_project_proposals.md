### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Active Inference Simulation in Medical Imaging

**What are you trying to do?**
- Develop and run simulations to understand how Active Inference can be applied to improve medical imaging processes, particularly in image reconstruction.

**How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**
- Currently, medical imaging relies heavily on optimization-based reconstruction algorithms, which can be computationally intensive and may not fully incorporate the dynamic and predictive aspects of biological systems. The limits include the lack of real-time adaptation and the inability to integrate prior knowledge effectively.

**What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?**
- This project introduces Active Inference to medical imaging by simulating how agents using Active Inference can adaptively reconstruct images. This approach leverages the Bayesian inference and predictive coding principles of Active Inference to incorporate prior knowledge and adapt to new data in real-time. The success is anticipated due to the potential of Active Inference to handle complex and dynamic systems more effectively than traditional methods.

**Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?**
- Success in this project could make a significant difference for medical imaging professionals and patients by providing more accurate and adaptive image reconstruction methods. This could lead to better diagnostic outcomes and more efficient use of imaging resources.

**What are the risks?**
- The primary risk is the complexity of integrating Active Inference with existing medical imaging protocols. There is also a risk of the simulations not accurately reflecting real-world scenarios.

**How much will it cost?**
- This project is expected to be low-cost, primarily requiring computational resources and access to simulation software.

**How long will it take?**
- The project is expected to take about 2-3 months, including literature review, simulation setup, and analysis.

**What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?**
- **Mid-term Check Point:** After 1 month, assess the feasibility of integrating Active Inference with existing medical imaging algorithms through preliminary simulations.
- **Final Check Point:** After 3 months, evaluate the performance of the Active Inference-based image reconstruction method against traditional methods through a comprehensive simulation study.

**Technical Details and Methodologies:**
- Use the Animal-AI Environment or similar simulation tools to model Active Inference agents in a medical imaging context.
- Implement simple Active Inference models using Python or MATLAB.
- Compare the performance of Active Inference-based reconstruction with traditional methods.

**Potential Collaborators or Resources:**
- Collaborate with researchers from the Active Inference Institute and medical imaging experts.
- Utilize resources from the Active Inference Institute, such as their YouTube channel and Discord community.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with Episodic Memory in Medical Decision-Making

**What are you trying to do?**
- Develop an Active Inference model that incorporates episodic memory to improve decision-making in medical contexts, such as patient treatment planning.

**How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**
- Current medical decision-making processes often rely on static models and do not fully incorporate the patient's past experiences or dynamic changes in their condition. The limits include the lack of personalization and the inability to adapt to new information effectively.

**What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?**
- This project integrates episodic memory into an Active Inference framework to create a more personalized and adaptive decision-making model. This approach leverages the Temporal Episodic Memory (TEM) module and Prioritised Replay Buffer (PRB) as described in the literature[3]. The success is anticipated due to the potential of episodic memory to enhance the agent's ability to learn from past experiences and adapt to new scenarios.

**Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?**
- Success in this project could significantly improve patient treatment planning by providing more personalized and adaptive decision-making models. This could lead to better patient outcomes and more efficient healthcare processes.

**What are the risks?**
- The primary risks include the complexity of integrating episodic memory with Active Inference and the potential for overfitting to past experiences.

**How much will it cost?**
- This project is expected to require moderate resources, including computational power and potential collaborations with experts in cognitive science and neuroscience.

**How long will it take?**
- The project is expected to take about 6-9 months, including literature review, model development, and validation.

**What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?**
- **Mid-term Check Point:** After 3 months, assess the feasibility of integrating episodic memory with Active Inference through preliminary simulations.
- **Final Check Point:** After 9 months, evaluate the performance of the Active Inference model with episodic memory in a clinical setting through a pilot study.

**Technical Details and Methodologies:**
- Implement the TEM module and PRB within an Active Inference framework using Python or MATLAB.
- Use case studies and simulations to validate the model.
- Collaborate with experts in cognitive science and neuroscience to ensure the model is grounded in empirical evidence.

**Potential Collaborators or Resources:**
- Collaborate with researchers from the Active Inference Institute and experts in cognitive science and neuroscience.
- Utilize resources from the Active Inference Institute, such as their educational projects and community forums.

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Applying Active Inference to Understand Peace and Social Behaviors

**What are you trying to do?**
- Develop a comprehensive Active Inference model to understand and predict social behaviors related to peace, integrating insights from cognitive science, neuroscience, and social sciences.

**How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**
- Current approaches to understanding peace and social behaviors are often fragmented and do not provide a unified framework for prediction and intervention. The limits include the lack of a cohesive theoretical framework and the inability to integrate multiple levels of analysis.

**What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?**
- This project applies the Active Inference framework to model social behaviors related to peace, leveraging its ability to unify perception and action under a single objective of minimizing free energy. The success is anticipated due to the potential of Active Inference to provide a cohesive and predictive framework for understanding complex social behaviors.

**Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?**
- Success in this project could make a significant difference in understanding and promoting peace by providing a predictive and actionable framework for policymakers, social scientists, and peace practitioners.

**What are the risks?**
- The primary risks include the complexity of modeling social behaviors, the potential for oversimplification, and the challenge of validating the model in real-world scenarios.

**How much will it cost?**
- This project is expected to require substantial resources, including funding for interdisciplinary collaborations, data collection, and computational infrastructure.

**How long will it take?**
- The project is expected to take about 1-2 years, including literature review, model development, validation, and dissemination.

**What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?**
- **Mid-term Check Point:** After 6 months, assess the feasibility of the Active Inference model through preliminary simulations and case studies.
- **Final Check Point:** After 2 years, evaluate the performance and impact of the Active Inference model in a real-world setting through a comprehensive field study.

**Technical Details and Methodologies:**
- Develop a hierarchical Active Inference model that integrates multiple levels of analysis (individual, group, societal).
- Use simulations and case studies to validate the model.
- Collaborate with experts from cognitive science, neuroscience, social sciences, and peace studies to ensure the model is grounded in empirical evidence.

**Potential Collaborators or Resources:**
- Collaborate with researchers from the Active Inference Institute, cognitive science, neuroscience, and social sciences departments.
