### Immediate Next Steps (1-2 weeks)

#### Specific Resources to Start With
- **Video Lecture by Dr. Sanjeev Namjoshi**:
  - Watch the YouTube video "The Hidden Math Behind All Living Systems" by Dr. Sanjeev Namjoshi to get an introductory overview of Active Inference, the Free Energy Principle, and Bayesian mechanics[4].
- **Active Inference Institute Livestreams**:
  - Explore the Active Inference Institute's livestreams, particularly the upcoming sessions like "From pixels to planning: scale-free active inference" with Karl Friston and Daniel Friedman, to get a feel for current discussions and applications in the field[5].

#### Initial Learning Objectives
- Understand the foundational concepts of Active Inference, including the Free Energy Principle and variational free energy minimization.
- Grasp the basic distinction between continuous and discrete implementations of Active Inference.

#### Concrete Actions to Take
- **Create a Notes System**:
  - Start a notebook or digital notes system to record key concepts, questions, and insights from the initial resources.
- **Join Online Communities**:
  - Sign up for the Active Inference Institute's Discord channel to engage with other learners and experts in the field[5].

### Short-Term Goals (1-3 months)

#### Key Concepts to Master
- **Generative Models and Agent-Environment Interaction**:
  - Delve into the mathematical formalisms behind generative models and agent-environment interactions as described in resources like the paper on "Active Inference with Episodic Memory in the Animal-AI Environment"[2].
- **Markov Blankets and System Boundaries**:
  - Understand the concept of Markov blankets and their role in defining system boundaries, as explained in Dr. Namjoshi's video and other resources[4].

#### Practical Exercises or Projects
- **Simulation Exercises**:
  - Use the Animal-AI Environment to run simple active inference agents and observe their behavior. This environment is designed to test cognitive capabilities and can be a hands-on way to learn about active inference[2].
- **Reading and Summarizing Key Papers**:
  - Read and summarize papers such as "Active causal structure learning in continuous time" to understand how active inference is applied in different contexts[1].

#### Recommended Study Materials
- **Books by Karl Friston**:
  - Start reading books by Karl Friston, a key figure in the field of Active Inference, to get a comprehensive understanding of the theory and its applications.
- **Academic Papers**:
  - Access papers through the Active Inference Institute or academic databases to deepen your understanding of specific topics, such as the integration of episodic memory into active inference agents[2][3].

#### Community Engagement Opportunities
- **Attend Livestreams and Webinars**:
  - Participate in the Active Inference Institute's livestreams and webinars, such as the "Applied Active Inference Symposium" to learn from experts and engage in discussions[5].
- **Contribute to Online Forums**:
  - Engage in discussions on the Active Inference Institute's Discord channel and other forums to clarify doubts and learn from others.

### Medium-Term Development (3-6 months)

#### Advanced Topics to Explore
- **Episodic Memory Integration**:
  - Dive deeper into how episodic memory is integrated into active inference agents, as discussed in the paper on "Active Inference with Episodic Memory in the Animal-AI Environment"[2].
- **Resource-Rational Behavior**:
  - Study the concept of resource-rational behavior and its application in active causal learning, as outlined in the paper on "Active causal structure learning in continuous time"[1].

#### Potential Collaboration Opportunities
- **Interdisciplinary Research Groups**:
  - Seek out research groups or collaborations that combine medical physics with active inference. This could involve reaching out to researchers in psychology, neuroscience, or philosophy.
- **Contribute to Educational Initiatives**:
  - Participate in or propose educational initiatives aimed at making active inference more accessible, leveraging your background in medical physics to create instructional materials.

#### Application Projects in Their Domain
- **Applying Active Inference to Medical Imaging**:
  - Explore how active inference can be applied to medical imaging problems, such as optimizing image reconstruction algorithms or understanding patient behavior.
- **Understanding Peace Through Active Inference**:
  - Start conceptualizing how active inference can be used to understand and analyze peace, potentially involving interdisciplinary collaborations.

#### Skill-Building Activities
- **Programming Skills**:
  - Develop or enhance programming skills in languages like Python, focusing on libraries and frameworks relevant to active inference, such as those used in the Animal-AI Environment.
- **Mathematical Modeling**:
  - Refine mathematical modeling skills, particularly in areas related to variational free energy minimization and Bayesian inference.
