  "content": "### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Active Inference in Medical Imaging Reconstruction\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nThe objective is to apply Active Inference principles to optimize medical imaging reconstruction algorithms, particularly in the context of image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT).\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrently, medical imaging reconstruction often relies on optimization-based algorithms that minimize errors between the observed data and the reconstructed image. However, these methods can be computationally intensive and may not fully account for the dynamic nature of the imaging process. The limits include high computational costs, potential for artifacts, and the need for extensive calibration.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThe new approach involves using Active Inference to model the imaging process as a generative model, where the system aims to minimize variational free energy. This framework can incorporate prior knowledge about the anatomy and physiological processes, allowing for more accurate and efficient reconstruction. By leveraging the Bayesian mechanics inherent in Active Inference, the system can adaptively learn from the data and reduce the need for extensive calibration.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nSuccess in this project will improve the accuracy and efficiency of medical imaging reconstruction, which is crucial for precise IGRT. This can lead to better patient outcomes, reduced radiation exposure, and more effective treatment planning. The methodology can also be extended to other medical imaging modalities.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\nThe primary risks include the complexity of integrating Active Inference into existing imaging protocols, the need for significant computational resources, and the potential for initial results to be less accurate due to the learning curve of the new methodology.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThe costs will be relatively low since the project will leverage existing computational resources and software frameworks. The main investment will be in time and expertise.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\nThis project is expected to take approximately 2-3 months to complete the initial implementation and testing.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Week 1-2:** Review existing literature on Active Inference and medical imaging reconstruction.\n- **Month 1:** Implement a basic Active Inference model for a simplified imaging scenario.\n- **Month 2:** Test the model with real-world data and compare with current methods.\n- **Month 3:** Refine the model based on initial results and document the findings.\n\n**Potential Collaborators/Resources:**\n- Collaborate with researchers in medical imaging and Active Inference.\n- Utilize the Animal-AI Environment for testing and validation.\n- Engage with the Active Inference Institute for community support and resources.\n\n### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Episodic Memory in Active Inference Agents for Medical Decision-Making\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nThe goal is to integrate episodic memory into Active Inference agents to enhance their decision-making capabilities in medical contexts, such as diagnosing diseases or optimizing treatment plans.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrently, Active Inference agents in medical contexts often rely on generative models that do not incorporate episodic memory. This limits their ability to learn from past experiences and adapt to new situations. The current practice is mainly based on model-based reinforcement learning without the rich contextual memory that episodic memory can provide.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThe new approach involves integrating the Prioritised Replay Buffer (PRB) and Temporal Episodic Memory (TEM) modules into the Active Inference framework. This will allow the agents to learn from past experiences, define a subjective timescale, and make more informed decisions. By leveraging episodic memory, the agents can better handle the exploration-exploitation trade-off and adapt to dynamic medical scenarios.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nSuccess in this project will significantly improve the decision-making capabilities of Active Inference agents in medical settings. This can lead to more accurate diagnoses, optimized treatment plans, and better patient outcomes. The integration of episodic memory will also enhance the agents' ability to handle complex, dynamic medical scenarios.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\nThe risks include the complexity of integrating episodic memory modules, potential issues with data storage and retrieval, and the need for extensive testing to ensure the agents' reliability.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThe costs will include time and expertise, as well as potential investments in computational resources for simulating and testing the agents.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\nThis project is expected to take approximately 6-9 months to complete, including the development, testing, and refinement of the episodic memory integrated Active Inference agents.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Month 1-2:** Review literature on episodic memory and Active Inference, and implement basic PRB and TEM modules.\n- **Month 3-4:** Integrate the modules into the Active Inference framework and test with simulated medical scenarios.\n- **Month 5-6:** Refine the agents based on initial results and conduct real-world testing.\n- **Month 7-9:** Document the findings and prepare for publication.\n\n**Potential Collaborators/Resources:**\n- Collaborate with researchers in neuroscience, cognitive science, and medical decision-making.\n- Utilize the Animal-AI Environment and other simulation tools for testing.\n- Engage with the Active Inference Institute for community support and resources.\n\n### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Applying Active Inference to Understand and Analyze Peace\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nThe objective is to apply Active Inference principles to understand and analyze peace at various scales, from individual to societal levels, and develop predictive models that can help in maintaining or achieving peace.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrently, the study of peace is often fragmented across disciplines such as psychology, sociology, and politics, with limited integration of theoretical frameworks. The limits include the lack of a unified theoretical framework, the complexity of measuring peace, and the difficulty in predicting peace outcomes.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThe new approach involves using Active Inference as a unifying framework to model the perception and action processes involved in peace. By applying the Free Energy Principle and variational free energy minimization, the project aims to develop a holistic understanding of peace that integrates individual and societal factors. This framework can predict how individuals and groups adapt to their environments to maintain or achieve peace.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nSuccess in this project will provide a groundbreaking framework for understanding and predicting peace, which can be crucial for policymakers, peacekeepers, and researchers. It can lead to more effective peacekeeping strategies, better conflict resolution methods, and a deeper understanding of the dynamics involved in maintaining peace.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\nThe risks include the complexity of applying Active Inference to a highly abstract and multifaceted concept like peace, potential challenges in data collection and validation, and the need for interdisciplinary collaboration.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThe costs will be significant, including investments in time, expertise, and potentially large-scale data collection efforts.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\nThis project is expected to take approximately 1-2 years to complete, including the development of the theoretical framework, data collection, testing, and refinement.\n\n#### 8.
