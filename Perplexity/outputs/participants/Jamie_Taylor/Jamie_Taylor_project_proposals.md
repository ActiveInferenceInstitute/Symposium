### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Applying Active Inference to Coach Decision-Making

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and implement a simple Active Inference model to enhance coach decision-making in high-performance sports, focusing on optimizing strategy formation and player performance.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, coaches rely on a combination of experience, intuition, and data analysis to make decisions. However, this approach can be reactive and may not fully integrate top-down and bottom-up processes. The limits include the lack of a systematic framework for minimizing prediction error and optimizing strategies.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project introduces Active Inference as a principled framework for coach decision-making. By using Bayesian inference and the free energy principle, coaches can better align their expectations with observed data, minimizing prediction error. This approach is new because it integrates cognitive and behavioral theories into a coherent decision-making framework.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Coaches, athletes, and sports organizations will benefit from improved decision-making processes, leading to enhanced player performance and better strategic outcomes. This can result in better team performance and a competitive edge.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risks include the difficulty in translating theoretical concepts into practical coaching strategies and the potential resistance from coaches who are accustomed to traditional methods.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The initial cost will be minimal, primarily involving time and resources for learning and implementing the Active Inference model. No significant external funding is required.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 2-3 months, with the following milestones:
- **Month 1:** Learn the foundational principles of Active Inference and develop a basic model.
- **Month 2:** Apply the model to a specific coaching scenario and gather initial feedback.
- **Month 3:** Refine the model based on feedback and integrate it into coaching practices.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point:** Successful implementation of the model in a single coaching session with positive feedback from coaches and athletes.
- **Final Check Point:** Integration of the Active Inference model into regular coaching practices with measurable improvements in team performance.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Active Inference in Talent Development Systems

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and implement an Active Inference-based framework for optimizing talent identification and development in sports, integrating both top-down and bottom-up approaches.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current talent development systems often rely on a mix of quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments. However, these systems can be fragmented and do not always account for the dynamic interactions between different levels of the system. The limits include the lack of a unified framework that integrates all stakeholders and levels of performance.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project applies Active Inference to create a unified framework that uses Bayesian inference and the free energy principle to minimize prediction error across different levels of the talent development system. This approach is new because it integrates cognitive and behavioral theories with systemic thinking, allowing for more coherent and adaptive talent development strategies.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Sports organizations, coaches, and athletes will benefit from a more systematic and adaptive approach to talent development, leading to better identification of potential, more effective development pathways, and ultimately, improved performance outcomes.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The risks include the complexity of integrating Active Inference into existing talent development systems, potential resistance from stakeholders, and the need for significant data collection and analysis.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require some external funding to cover the costs of data collection tools, software, and potential collaboration with other researchers or consultants. Estimated costs could be around £10,000 to £20,000.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 6-9 months, with the following milestones:
- **Months 1-3:** Develop the theoretical framework and initial model.
- **Months 4-6:** Implement the model in a pilot study within a sports organization.
- **Months 7-9:** Analyze results, refine the model, and prepare for broader implementation.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point:** Successful pilot implementation with positive feedback from stakeholders.
- **Final Check Point:** Widespread adoption of the Active Inference-based framework within the sports organization, with measurable improvements in talent identification and development outcomes.

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Active Inference in Collective Intelligence for Sports Teams

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a comprehensive Active Inference model to enhance collective intelligence in sports teams, integrating theory of mind and goal alignment to improve team performance and strategic coherence.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, team performance is optimized through a combination of individual skill development, tactical planning, and team cohesion strategies. However, these approaches often lack a unified theoretical framework that accounts for the complex interactions within the team. The limits include the lack of a systematic way to integrate individual and collective behaviors.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project applies Active Inference to model collective intelligence by incorporating theory of mind and goal alignment. This approach is new because it uses a principled framework to understand how individual agents within a team interact and align their goals, leading to more coherent and adaptive team behaviors.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Sports teams, coaches, and athletes will benefit from enhanced collective intelligence, leading to better team performance, more effective strategy execution, and improved overall outcomes.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The risks include the complexity of modeling collective intelligence, the need for extensive data collection and analysis, potential resistance from stakeholders, and the challenge of translating theoretical models into practical strategies.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require significant external funding to cover the costs of data collection tools, software, and collaboration with other researchers or consultants. Estimated costs could be around £50,000 to £100,000.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 1-2 years, with the following milestones:
- **Year 1:** Develop the theoretical framework, initial model, and data collection protocols.
- **Year 2:** Implement the model in a pilot study within a sports team, analyze results, refine the model, and prepare for broader implementation.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point:** Successful development of the theoretical framework and initial model, with positive feedback from stakeholders.
- **Final Check Point:** Widespread adoption of the Active Inference-based model within sports teams, with measurable improvements in team performance and collective intelligence.

### Potential Collaborators and Resources:
- **Collaborators:** Researchers from neuroscience, psychology, and AI; sports scientists and coaches.
- **Resources:** Active Inference Institute materials, Frontiers in Human Neuroscience journal, Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging events, and software tools like the Active Inference Toolbox.
- **Funding:** Potential funding sources include sports research grants, NSF grants, and philanthropic foundations focused on STEM and sports research.
