### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Implementing a Simple Active Inference Model in a Controlled Environment

**1. What are you trying to do?**
Create and implement a simple Active Inference model in a controlled simulation environment to understand the basic principles and application of Active Inference.

**2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**
Currently, Active Inference models are often implemented in complex systems, requiring a deep understanding of Bayesian inference, control theory, and neurobiology. However, for beginners, there is a lack of straightforward, step-by-step guides for implementing these models in simple scenarios.

**3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?**
This project will utilize the RxInfer.jl software framework, which is specifically designed for Active Inference. By following the Active Inference Institute's weekly sessions and tutorials, the project will ensure a structured and supported learning environment. The simplicity of the controlled simulation will allow for easy debugging and understanding of the model's behavior.

**4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?**
Success in this project will provide Matthew Moroney with a solid foundation in Active Inference, enabling him to apply the principles in more complex scenarios later. It will also contribute to the community by providing a clear, step-by-step guide for other beginners.

**5. What are the risks?**
The main risk is the potential difficulty in understanding the underlying mathematical and theoretical concepts without adequate background. However, the support from the Active Inference Institute and the community will mitigate this risk.

**6. How much will it cost?**
This project will not incur significant costs, as it will leverage free resources such as the RxInfer.jl software and the Active Inference Institute's tutorials and community support.

**7. How long will it take?**
This project is expected to take approximately 1-2 months to complete, depending on the frequency of the weekly sessions and the depth of the simulation.

**8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?**
- **Mid-term Checkpoint:** Successful implementation of a basic Active Inference model in a simple simulation environment (after 4-6 weeks).
- **Final Checkpoint:** Completion of the simulation, analysis of the results, and a written report detailing the process and findings (after 1-2 months).

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Applying Active Inference to Bioregional Economic Modeling

**1. What are you trying to do?**
Apply Active Inference principles to bioregional economic modeling to enhance sustainable growth and resource management in specific geographic regions.

**2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**
Currently, bioregional economic models often rely on traditional economic theories and lack the adaptive and predictive capabilities that Active Inference can offer. These models are limited by their inability to dynamically adjust to changing environmental and economic conditions.

**3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?**
This project will integrate Active Inference with existing bioregional economic models, allowing for adaptive decision-making and better prediction of outcomes. The use of Bayesian inference and control theory will enable the model to learn from data and adjust its parameters in real-time, enhancing sustainability and resource efficiency.

**4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?**
Success in this project will impact regional economic planning and sustainability efforts by providing a more adaptive and predictive framework. It will also contribute to the broader field of Active Inference by demonstrating its applicability in real-world economic scenarios.

**5. What are the risks?**
The main risks include the complexity of integrating Active Inference with existing economic models and the potential for data quality issues. Collaboration with economists and environmental scientists will be crucial to mitigate these risks.

**6. How much will it cost?**
This project may require some funding for data acquisition and potentially collaborating with experts from economics and environmental science. However, leveraging open-source tools and community resources can keep costs manageable.

**7. How long will it take?**
This project is expected to take approximately 3-6 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the model and the availability of data.

**8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?**
- **Mid-term Checkpoint:** Successful integration of Active Inference principles with a basic bioregional economic model (after 2-3 months).
- **Final Checkpoint:** Completion of the model, analysis of its performance using real-world data, and a written report detailing the methodology and results (after 3-6 months).

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing a Decentralized AI Framework Using Active Inference

**1. What are you trying to do?**
Develop a decentralized AI framework that leverages Active Inference to enhance decision-making, adaptability, and governance in decentralized AI systems.

**2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**
Current decentralized AI systems often lack robust mechanisms for adaptive decision-making and governance. They are limited by their inability to integrate insights from multiple agents and adapt to changing conditions in a principled manner.

**3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?**
This project will use Active Inference to create a framework where decentralized AI agents can learn from their environment, adapt to new information, and make decisions based on a unified principle of minimizing free energy. The integration of Bayesian inference and control theory will enable the agents to cooperate and adjust their behavior dynamically.

**4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?**
Success in this project will revolutionize the field of decentralized AI by providing a framework that enhances adaptability, cooperation, and governance. It will have significant implications for various domains such as robotics, autonomous systems, and smart cities.

**5. What are the risks?**
The main risks include the complexity of developing a decentralized framework, potential scalability issues, and the need for significant computational resources. Collaboration with experts in AI, control theory, and neuroscience will be essential to mitigate these risks.

**6. How much will it cost?**
This project will require substantial funding for research, development, and testing. It may also involve collaboration with other institutions or industries, which could add to the costs.

**7. How long will it take?**
This project is expected to take approximately 1-2 years to complete, depending on the complexity of the framework and the availability of resources.

**8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?**
- **Mid-term Checkpoint 1:** Successful development of a basic decentralized AI agent using Active Inference principles (after 6 months).
- **Mid-term Checkpoint 2:** Integration of multiple agents and initial testing of the decentralized framework (after 1 year).
- **Final Checkpoint:** Completion of the decentralized AI framework, comprehensive testing, and a detailed report on the methodology, results, and implications (after 1-2 years).

Each of these proposals is tailored to Matthew Moroney's learning plan and leverages the resources and community support available in the Active Inference field. They provide a structured path from introductory to advanced applications, ensuring a progressive and impactful engagement with Active Inference.
