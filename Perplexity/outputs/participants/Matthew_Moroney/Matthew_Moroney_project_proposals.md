### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Simulating Basic Active Inference Models

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create and simulate basic Active Inference models using software tools to understand the foundational concepts and apply them in a controlled environment.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, simulating Active Inference models involves using specialized software such as MATLAB or Python libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow. However, for newcomers, the complexity of setting up these models and interpreting the results can be a significant barrier. The limits include the steep learning curve for those without a strong background in programming and mathematical modeling.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will utilize pre-built templates and tutorials provided by the First Principles First (FP1) platform to simplify the process of setting up and simulating basic Active Inference models. By following step-by-step guides and participating in online forums for support, the learning curve can be significantly reduced. Success is likely because it leverages existing educational resources and community support.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will help Matthew Moroney gain a practical understanding of Active Inference, enabling him to contribute to discussions and projects within the community. It will also lay the groundwork for more advanced applications in the future.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risks include the potential for misunderstanding the models due to lack of background knowledge and the possibility of encountering technical issues with the software tools.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project should be low-cost, as it primarily involves using free or low-cost software tools and online resources.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project can be completed within 1-2 months, depending on the frequency of work sessions.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint**: After one month, evaluate the ability to set up and run a basic Active Inference model successfully.
- **Final Checkpoint**: After two months, assess the understanding of the model's behavior and the ability to interpret the results.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Applying Active Inference to Decision-Making Processes

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Apply Active Inference principles to enhance decision-making processes in a specific domain, such as artificial intelligence or neuroscience, by developing and testing a more sophisticated model.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, decision-making models often rely on traditional Bayesian inference or control theory without fully integrating the holistic approach of Active Inference. The limits include the lack of comprehensive frameworks that combine multiple disciplines effectively.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will integrate advanced Bayesian methods and control theory within the Active Inference framework to develop a more robust decision-making model. Success is anticipated due to the interdisciplinary nature of the approach, leveraging recent advancements in Active Inference research.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success will contribute to the development of more accurate and adaptive decision-making models, which can have significant impacts in fields such as AI, neuroscience, and other areas requiring complex decision processes.

#### 5. What are the risks?
Risks include the complexity of integrating multiple disciplines, potential mathematical and computational challenges, and the need for validation of the model in real-world scenarios.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project may require access to more advanced software tools or computational resources, potentially incurring moderate costs.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take 3-6 months, depending on the complexity of the model and the availability of resources.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint**: After three months, evaluate the feasibility of the integrated model and its initial performance.
- **Final Checkpoint**: After six months, assess the model's performance in real-world or simulated scenarios and gather feedback from peers or mentors.

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing an Interdisciplinary Active Inference Framework for Complex Systems

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a comprehensive, interdisciplinary Active Inference framework that can be applied to complex systems across multiple domains, such as neuroscience, AI, and decision-making.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, Active Inference is applied in various domains but often in a siloed manner. The limits include the lack of a unified framework that can seamlessly integrate insights from neuroscience, control theory, and Bayesian inference.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will involve collaborating with experts from multiple disciplines to develop a unified framework. Success is anticipated due to the collaborative and interdisciplinary approach, which will leverage the latest research and advancements in each field.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success will lead to a groundbreaking framework that can be applied across diverse fields, enhancing our understanding of complex systems and improving decision-making processes significantly.

#### 5. What are the risks?
Risks include the challenges of interdisciplinary collaboration, the complexity of integrating diverse theoretical frameworks, and the need for extensive validation and testing.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project could be resource-intensive, requiring significant funding for software, computational resources, and potentially hiring collaborators or consultants.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take 6-12 months or more, depending on the scope and complexity of the framework.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint**: After six months, evaluate the progress on the framework's development and the feasibility of its components.
- **Final Checkpoint**: After 12 months, assess the completeness of the framework, its performance in various domains, and gather feedback from a broad range of stakeholders.

Each of these proposals aligns with the learning plan and gradually increases in scope and complexity, allowing Matthew Moroney to build a comprehensive understanding and application of Active Inference.
