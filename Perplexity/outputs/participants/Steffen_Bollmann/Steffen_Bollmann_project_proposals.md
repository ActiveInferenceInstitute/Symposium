### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference in Simple Neuroimaging Tasks

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Implement a basic Active Inference model to analyze and interpret simple neuroimaging data, such as MRI scans, to enhance data analysis and interpretation.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, neuroimaging data analysis relies heavily on traditional statistical methods and machine learning algorithms. However, these methods often lack the dynamic and adaptive capabilities that Active Inference can provide. The limits of current practice include the inability to account for complex interactions between the brain and its environment in real-time.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project introduces the application of Active Inference to neuroimaging data analysis. By using predictive coding and free energy principle, Active Inference can provide a more holistic and dynamic approach to understanding brain function. This approach is new because it integrates Bayesian inference and action-perception loops, which can better capture the complex dynamics of brain activity.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will make a difference by providing neuroimaging researchers and clinicians with a more advanced and adaptive tool for data analysis. This can lead to better diagnostic capabilities and more accurate interpretations of neuroimaging data, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the learning curve associated with implementing Active Inference, potential difficulties in integrating these methods with existing software tools, and the need for validation of the new approach against established methods.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The costs will be minimal, primarily involving time and resources for learning and implementing Active Inference models. Access to existing software tools and libraries (e.g., SPM) will be utilized.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take about 2-3 months, including the initial learning phase, implementation, and validation.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Week 1-2:** Complete introductory readings and join online forums.
- **Month 1:** Implement a simple Active Inference model using MATLAB or Python.
- **Month 2-3:** Apply the model to a simple neuroimaging dataset and validate the results against traditional methods.
- **Final Check Point:** Present the findings in a local workshop or seminar to gather feedback.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Active Inference in Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and apply Active Inference models to enhance the analysis and interpretation of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) data in neuroimaging.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, QSM data analysis involves several steps including phase unwrapping, background field removal, and dipole inversion. However, these methods can be sensitive to artifacts and require manual adjustments. The limits include the lack of automated and adaptive methods to handle complex data.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will integrate Active Inference principles into QSM data analysis to provide an automated and adaptive approach. By using predictive coding and free energy minimization, Active Inference can help in robustly handling artifacts and improving the accuracy of susceptibility maps. This approach is new because it combines Bayesian inference with the physical principles of QSM.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of QSM data analysis, which is crucial for clinical applications such as diagnosing and monitoring neurological disorders. This can lead to better diagnostic tools and improved patient care.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The risks include the complexity of integrating Active Inference with existing QSM pipelines, potential computational costs, and the need for extensive validation against current gold standards.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The costs will involve time and resources for developing and validating the new approach. There may be some costs associated with accessing high-performance computing resources if necessary.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take about 6-9 months, including the development, implementation, and validation phases.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Month 1-2:** Develop a basic Active Inference model for QSM data.
- **Month 3-4:** Integrate the model into existing QSM pipelines.
- **Month 5-6:** Validate the approach using real-world datasets.
- **Final Check Point:** Present the findings at a major conference (e.g., ISMRM) and submit a paper for peer review.

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Active Inference for Personalized Neuroimaging in Clinical Settings

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a comprehensive framework that integrates Active Inference with quantitative MRI and image segmentation to create personalized diagnostic and therapeutic tools for neurological disorders in clinical settings.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, clinical neuroimaging relies on standardized protocols and group-level analyses, which may not capture individual variations effectively. The limits include the lack of personalized models that can adapt to individual patient data and the absence of real-time feedback mechanisms.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will develop a personalized neuroimaging framework using Active Inference. By integrating predictive coding, free energy principle, and hierarchical inference, the framework will provide adaptive and real-time analysis of individual patient data. This approach is new because it combines advanced machine learning techniques with the principles of Active Inference to create highly personalized models.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will revolutionize clinical neuroimaging by providing highly personalized diagnostic and therapeutic tools. This can lead to more accurate diagnoses, targeted interventions, and significantly improved patient outcomes.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The risks include the complexity of developing such a comprehensive framework, potential ethical issues related to personalized data, and the need for extensive clinical validation and regulatory approvals.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The costs will be significant, involving substantial time and resources for development, validation, and clinical trials. There may also be costs associated with collaborating with clinical institutions and accessing necessary datasets.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take about 2-3 years, including the development, validation, and clinical trial phases.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Year 1:** Develop the basic framework and initial models.
- **Year 1.5:** Integrate the framework with existing clinical protocols and start pilot studies.
- **Year 2:** Conduct extensive validation and clinical trials.
- **Final Check Point:** Publish the results in high-impact journals and present at major conferences, followed by seeking regulatory approvals for clinical use.
