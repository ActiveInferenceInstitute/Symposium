### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) for Enhanced Neuroimaging Interpretation

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a method to integrate Active Inference with Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) to improve the interpretation of neuroimaging data, particularly in understanding the underlying neural activity.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, QSM is used to quantify magnetic susceptibility in tissues, but it does not directly inform about neural activity. Active Inference, on the other hand, models neural activity but lacks direct integration with quantitative imaging techniques. The current practice is limited by the lack of a unified framework that combines these two approaches.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will develop a novel integration of Active Inference models with QSM data. By using the SPM software and Neurodesk for data analysis, we will create a pipeline that corrects QSM data for non-neural factors (as described in [1]) and then uses Active Inference to model the neural activity associated with the corrected susceptibility maps. This integration will provide a more comprehensive understanding of brain function.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Neuroscientists, clinicians, and researchers in cognitive science will benefit from this integration. It will enhance the accuracy of neuroimaging interpretations, allowing for better diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. This could particularly impact the study and treatment of neurological disorders.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of integrating two distinct methodologies and the potential for misinterpretation of the combined data. Ensuring the reproducibility and validity of the results will be crucial.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project will utilize existing resources such as SPM software and Neurodesk, reducing costs. Initial estimates suggest minimal additional funding for software licenses or travel to workshops.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 3-6 months, with the following milestones:
- **Month 1:** Develop the integration pipeline.
- **Month 2-3:** Test and validate the pipeline using existing datasets.
- **Month 4-6:** Analyze results and prepare for publication.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Month 1:** Successful development of the integration pipeline.
- **Month 3:** Initial validation results using test datasets.
- **Month 6:** Final analysis and preparation for publication.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Developing Reproducible Neuroimaging Pipelines with Active Inference for Clinical Applications

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and implement reproducible neuroimaging pipelines that incorporate Active Inference models for clinical applications, ensuring high standards of data quality and analysis transparency.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, neuroimaging pipelines often lack standardization and transparency, leading to issues with reproducibility. Active Inference is not commonly integrated into these pipelines, and when it is, the methods are often not standardized.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will establish a standardized pipeline using Neurodesk and SPM software to integrate Active Inference models with quantitative MRI data. The pipeline will include automated data preprocessing, Active Inference modeling, and post-processing steps, all within a reproducible framework. This will be achieved through collaborations with researchers from the Active Inference and neuroimaging communities.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Clinicians, researchers, and patients will benefit from more reliable and interpretable neuroimaging data. This project will enhance diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic effectiveness, particularly in neurological and psychiatric disorders.

#### 5. What are the risks?
Risks include the complexity of standardizing the pipeline across different datasets and clinical settings, as well as ensuring the pipeline's flexibility and adaptability.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
Estimated costs include software licenses, travel to workshops, and potential collaboration expenses. Initial funding will be sought from research grants and institutional support.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 6-12 months, with the following milestones:
- **Month 1-3:** Develop the initial pipeline framework.
- **Month 4-6:** Test and validate the pipeline using various datasets.
- **Month 7-12:** Refine the pipeline based on feedback and prepare for broader implementation.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Month 3:** Successful development of the initial pipeline framework.
- **Month 6:** Initial validation results.
- **Month 12:** Final refinement and preparation for broader implementation.

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Translating Active Inference into Clinical Practice through Integrated Quantitative MRI and Deep Learning

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a comprehensive framework that integrates Active Inference with quantitative MRI and deep learning techniques to create a clinically applicable tool for diagnosing and treating neurological disorders.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, Active Inference, quantitative MRI, and deep learning are used separately or in limited combinations. Clinical applications are hindered by the lack of a unified framework that leverages the strengths of each approach.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will combine the strengths of Active Inference, quantitative MRI (including QSM), and deep learning to create a robust and clinically relevant framework. The framework will involve:
- Developing deep learning models to enhance QSM and other quantitative MRI techniques.
- Integrating these models with Active Inference to better understand neural activity.
- Collaborating with clinicians and industry partners to ensure the framework is clinically viable.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will significantly impact clinical neuroscience by providing a powerful tool for diagnosing and treating neurological disorders. It will improve patient outcomes and advance the field of neuroimaging.

#### 5. What are the risks?
Risks include the complexity of integrating multiple advanced methodologies, ensuring the clinical validity of the framework, and securing long-term funding and support.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
Estimated costs are substantial and will include funding for software development, collaboration expenses, and potential industry partnerships. Seeking grants from major research funding agencies will be necessary.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 2-3 years, with the following milestones:
- **Year 1:** Develop the initial framework and integrate deep learning models with QSM.
- **Year 2:** Integrate Active Inference models and test the framework using clinical datasets.
- **Year 3:** Refine the framework based on clinical feedback and prepare for widespread implementation.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Year 1:** Successful integration of deep learning models with QSM.
- **Year 2:** Initial validation results using clinical datasets.
- **Year 3:** Final refinement and preparation for widespread implementation.

Each of these proposals leverages Dr. Bollmann's expertise in quantitative MRI and image segmentation while introducing and integrating Active Inference, ensuring a realistic and impactful learning and application path.
