## Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Simulating Cell Activity Using Active Inference

### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create a simple simulation model to predict and analyze cell activity using active inference principles.

### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, cell activity is often modeled using traditional statistical methods or basic machine learning algorithms. However, these methods lack the integration of prior knowledge and sensory inputs, which are crucial for accurate predictions. The limits of current practice include the inability to account for uncertainty and the lack of a unified framework that combines both prior experiences and real-time data.

### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will use active inference to integrate prior knowledge about cell behavior with real-time sensory inputs. By employing the free energy principle, the model will minimize the difference between predicted and actual cell states, thereby providing a more accurate and dynamic prediction of cell activity. This approach is new because it leverages the theoretical foundations of active inference to handle uncertainty and probabilistic computations, which are essential for biological systems.

### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will make a significant difference in the field of cellular biology and biomedical research. It will provide a more accurate and robust method for predicting cell behavior, which can be crucial for understanding cellular processes, drug development, and personalized medicine. This model can also serve as a foundational tool for more complex biological simulations.

### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of implementing active inference models, the need for high-quality data, and the potential for overfitting or underfitting the model. Additionally, there is a risk that the model may not capture the full complexity of cellular behavior.

### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will primarily require computational resources and software tools such as `spm_free` or `TAPAS`, which are open-source or freely available. Therefore, the costs are minimal and mainly related to the time and effort invested.

### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 2-4 weeks to complete, depending on the complexity of the model and the availability of data.

### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Week 1:** Complete the setup of the software environment and initial data preprocessing.
- **Week 2:** Implement the basic active inference model and run initial simulations.
- **Week 3-4:** Refine the model based on preliminary results, optimize parameters, and validate the model against real-world data.

## Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with Machine Learning for Agricultural Optimization

### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop an integrated model that combines active inference with machine learning to optimize agricultural practices such as crop yield prediction and resource allocation.

### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, agricultural optimization often relies on machine learning models that predict outcomes based on historical data. However, these models do not fully incorporate the dynamic and uncertain nature of agricultural systems. The limits include the lack of real-time adaptation, failure to account for prior knowledge, and limited handling of uncertainty.

### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will integrate active inference with machine learning to create a model that adapts in real-time and incorporates both prior knowledge and sensory inputs. By using the free energy principle, the model will optimize predictions and decisions based on minimizing the difference between expected and actual outcomes. This approach is new because it combines the strengths of active inference in handling uncertainty and probabilistic computations with the predictive power of machine learning.

### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will significantly impact agricultural practices by providing more accurate and adaptive models for crop yield prediction and resource allocation. This can lead to improved crop yields, reduced resource usage, and better decision-making in agriculture, ultimately benefiting farmers, the environment, and food security.

### 5. What are the risks?
The risks include the complexity of integrating two different methodologies, the need for high-quality and diverse data sets, and the potential for model overfitting or underfitting. Additionally, there is a risk that the model may not generalize well across different agricultural contexts.

### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require access to computational resources, machine learning frameworks, and potentially some funding for data collection or collaboration with agricultural experts. The costs are moderate, primarily related to time, data, and potential collaborations.

### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 3-6 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the integration and the availability of data.

## Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing a Unified Framework for Probabilistic Representations in the Brain Using Active Inference

### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a unified framework for understanding how the brain represents probability distributions using active inference principles, integrating insights from probabilistic population codes, distributed distributional codes, and neural sampling codes.

### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, the representation of probability distributions in the brain is studied through various models such as probabilistic population codes (PPCs), distributed distributional codes (DDCs), and neural sampling codes (NSCs). However, these models are often studied in isolation, and there is a lack of a unified framework that compares and integrates these models effectively. The limits include the inconsistency in notation, differing assumptions, and the rarity of direct comparisons between these models[1].

### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will use active inference to develop a unified language and framework for comparing and integrating PPCs, DDCs, and NSCs. By applying the free energy principle, the framework will provide a common basis for understanding how neural activity represents probability distributions. This approach is new because it leverages the theoretical foundations of active inference to address the complexities and inconsistencies in current models.

### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will revolutionize the field of neuroscience and cognitive science by providing a unified understanding of how the brain computes with probabilities. This will have significant implications for understanding perception, decision-making, and learning, and can lead to breakthroughs in treating neurological disorders and improving artificial intelligence systems.

### 5. What are the risks?
The risks include the complexity of integrating multiple theoretical models, the need for extensive empirical data, and the potential for significant theoretical and practical challenges in developing a unified framework. Additionally, there is a risk that the framework may not be widely accepted or may face significant criticism from the scientific community.

### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require significant resources, including funding for data collection, computational resources, and potentially collaborations with multiple research groups. The costs are substantial and will likely involve seeking grants or funding opportunities.

### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 1-2 years to complete, depending on the complexity of the integration and the availability of data.
