### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Simulating Basic Active Inference Models in Biological Contexts

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create and simulate basic active inference models to understand how they can be applied to simple biological systems, such as cellular activity or basic sensory perception.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, active inference models are often complex and require significant computational resources. The limits include the difficulty in simplifying these models for educational or introductory purposes and the lack of accessible, user-friendly tools for beginners.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
- **Simplification and Accessibility**: Develop simplified active inference models that can be easily simulated using common programming languages like Python or MATLAB.
- **Educational Focus**: Create tutorials and examples that help newcomers understand the basics of active inference through practical simulations.
- **Collaboration**: Utilize online communities and forums to gather feedback and improve the models.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will make active inference more accessible to a broader audience, including students and early-stage researchers. It will provide a stepping stone for deeper exploration of active inference in biological systems.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Simplification Oversights**: Over-simplification might miss critical aspects of active inference.
- **Limited Generalizability**: The models might not be scalable to more complex biological systems.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will primarily require time and computational resources, which are likely already available given Zach Baker's current setup. No significant additional funding is required.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- **Duration**: 1-2 months
- **Milestones**:
  - Week 1: Literature review and model design
  - Week 2-4: Implementation and simulation
  - Week 5-6: Documentation and tutorial creation
  - Week 7-8: Feedback gathering and model refinement

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint**: Successful simulation of a basic active inference model within the first month.
- **Final Checkpoint**: Completion of tutorials and feedback from the community within two months.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Applying Active Inference to Model Cell Activity and Decision-Making

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Use active inference to model and simulate cell activity and decision-making processes in more complex biological systems, such as neural networks or immune cells.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, modeling cell activity and decision-making involves complex mathematical models and significant computational power. The limits include the lack of integration with active inference principles and the difficulty in interpreting the results in a biologically meaningful way.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
- **Integration with Active Inference**: Apply active inference principles to model how cells make decisions based on their environment.
- **Biologically Relevant Models**: Ensure the models are grounded in biological data and can be interpreted in a biologically meaningful way.
- **Collaboration with Biologists**: Work with biologists to validate the models and ensure they align with empirical data.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will provide a new framework for understanding how cells make decisions, which can have significant implications for fields like immunology, neuroscience, and drug development.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Complexity**: The models may become too complex to manage or interpret.
- **Data Integration**: Integrating biological data with active inference models can be challenging.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project may require some additional funding for computational resources or collaboration with biologists. However, the costs are likely to be moderate.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- **Duration**: 3-6 months
- **Milestones**:
  - Month 1: Literature review and model design
  - Month 2-3: Implementation and simulation
  - Month 4-5: Validation with biological data and collaboration with biologists
  - Month 6: Finalize and present the results

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint**: Successful simulation of cell activity models within the first three months.
- **Final Checkpoint**: Completion of the validation phase and presentation of the results within six months.

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing an Integrated Framework for Active Inference in Complex Biological Systems

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop an integrated framework that combines active inference with other computational models (e.g., Bayesian reinforcement learning, neural circuit models) to simulate and understand complex biological systems such as entire organisms or ecosystems.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, modeling complex biological systems involves piecemeal approaches with different models for different aspects of the system. The limits include the lack of a unified framework and the difficulty in scaling these models to complex systems.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
- **Unified Framework**: Develop a comprehensive framework that integrates active inference with other computational models.
- **Scalability**: Ensure the framework is scalable to complex biological systems.
- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Collaborate with experts from neuroscience, biology, and computer science to ensure the framework is robust and applicable.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will revolutionize the way we understand complex biological systems, enabling better predictions, interventions, and understandings in fields such as medicine, ecology, and biotechnology.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Complexity and Integration**: Integrating multiple models into a unified framework is highly complex and risky.
- **Scalability Issues**: The framework might not scale as expected to complex systems.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will likely require significant funding for computational resources, collaborative efforts, and potentially hiring additional personnel.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- **Duration**: 12-24 months
- **Milestones**:
  - Month 1-3: Literature review and framework design
  - Month 4-6: Initial implementation and testing
  - Month 7-12: Refinement and validation with complex biological systems
  - Month 13-24: Finalization, testing, and dissemination of the framework

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint**: Successful initial implementation and testing within the first six months.
- **Final Checkpoint**: Completion of the framework and its validation with complex biological systems within 24 months.

Each of these proposals aligns with Zach Baker's background and interests, leverages his current expertise, and provides a structured path for growth and contribution to the field of active inference.
