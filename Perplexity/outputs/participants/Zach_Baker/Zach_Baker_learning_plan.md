### Personalized Learning Plan for Zach Baker: Active Inference

#### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Research Articles:**
  - Start with the paper on "Organoid Intelligence (OI): The New Frontier in Biocomputing and Biological Learning"[1] to understand the intersection of biological and machine learning.
  - Read the abstract and introduction of papers on active inference, such as those presented at ICML 2024, to grasp the current state of the field[2].

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the fundamental principles of active inference.
- Familiarize yourself with the current applications and challenges in the field.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Spend 2 hours each day for the next week reading and taking notes on the provided research articles.
- Create a mind map or concept diagram to visualize the relationships between active inference, Bayesian methods, and biological learning.
- Join online forums or discussion groups related to active inference and machine learning to engage with the community.

#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Probabilistic Brain Computations:** Delve into how the brain represents and computes with probabilities.
- **Bayesian Reinforcement Learning:** Understand the role of Bayesian methods in reinforcement learning within active inference.
- **Biological Applications:** Study how active inference is applied in biological systems, such as perception and decision-making.

**Practical Exercises or Projects:**
- **Simulation Projects:** Use software tools like MATLAB or Python to simulate simple active inference models. For example, simulate a basic Bayesian inference process in a biological context.
- **Literature Review:** Conduct a detailed review of recent papers on active inference and its applications, summarizing key findings and methodologies.

**Recommended Study Materials:**
