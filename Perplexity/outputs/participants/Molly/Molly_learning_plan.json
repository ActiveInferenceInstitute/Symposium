Here is a detailed, structured learning plan for Molly:\n\n## Immediate Next Steps (1-2 weeks)\n\n### Specific Resources to Start With\n- **Introduction to Active Inference**:\n  - Start with the blog post \"Spinning Up in Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle\" by Jared Tumiel. This provides a comprehensive overview and a syllabus for learning the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference[4].\n  - Read the abstract and introduction of the paper \"Active inference and learning\" to understand the core concepts and distinctions between goal-directed and habitual behavior[3].\n\n### Initial Learning Objectives\n- Gain a basic understanding of the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference.\n- Understand the distinction between goal-directed and habitual behavior.\n- Familiarize yourself with key terms like epistemic value, exploration, and exploitation.\n\n### Concrete Actions to Take\n- Spend 2-3 hours reading the introductory materials mentioned above.\n- Take notes on key concepts and questions that arise.\n- Join online forums or discussion groups (e.g., Reddit's r/ActiveInference, research groups on LinkedIn) to ask initial questions and get a feel for the community.\n\n## Short-Term Goals (1-3 months)\n\n### Key Concepts to Master\n- **Bayesian Inference and Variational Inference**:\n  - Study the basics of Bayesian inference and variational inference using resources like David MacKay's textbook \"Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms\"[4].\n  - Watch introductory videos on Bayesian inference and variational inference available on YouTube or Coursera.\n\n- **Computational Neuroscience**:\n  - Enroll in the Neuromatch Academy summer school or access its free online materials to get started with computational neuroscience[4].\n\n### Practical Exercises or Projects\n- **Simulations and Modeling**:\n  - Use Python libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow to implement simple Active Inference models. Start with tutorials available on these platforms.\n  - Participate in coding challenges or projects on platforms like Kaggle or GitHub to practice implementing Active Inference models.\n\n### Recommended Study Materials\n- **Academic Papers**:\n  - Read papers by Friston et al. and other key researchers in the field. Start with papers like \"Active inference and learning\"[3].\n  - Explore the recent work on hybrid active inference models for a deeper understanding of the latest developments[1].\n\n- **Courses and Tutorials**:\n  - Take online courses on Bayesian inference, variational inference, and computational neuroscience. Platforms like Coursera, edX, and Udemy often have relevant courses.\n  - Utilize tutorials and workshops available through the Computational Psychiatry course, which includes lectures by Karl Friston[4].\n\n### Community Engagement Opportunities\n- **Join Online Forums**:\n  - Participate in discussions on Reddit, LinkedIn groups, and other online forums dedicated to Active Inference.\n  - Attend webinars or online seminars hosted by research institutions or conferences related to Active Inference.\n\n## Medium-Term Development (3-6 months)\n\n### Advanced Topics to Explore\n- **Hybrid Active Inference Models**:\n  - Delve deeper into the paper on \"Learning in Hybrid Active Inference Models\" to understand the integration of discrete and continuous variables in decision-making[1].\n  - Explore the use of recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS) in hybrid models.\n\n- **Clinical and Therapeutic Applications**:\n  - Study the application of Active Inference in therapeutic and clinical settings. Use resources from the Computational Psychiatry course to understand these applications[4].\n\n### Potential Collaboration Opportunities\n- **Research Collaboration**:\n  - Reach out to researchers or institutions working on Active Inference projects. Look for opportunities to collaborate on research papers or projects.\n  - Participate in interdisciplinary projects that integrate Active Inference with other disciplines like psychology or artificial intelligence.\n\n- **Interdisciplinary Projects**:\n  - Engage in projects that apply Active Inference to real-world problems, such as decision-making in complex environments or understanding human behavior.\n\n### Application Projects in Their Domain\n- **Domain-Specific Applications**:\n  - Identify how Active Inference can be applied in Molly's specific domain of interest (e.g., psychology, neuroscience, AI).\n  - Develop a project proposal that integrates Active Inference with her domain-specific interests.\n\n### Skill-Building Activities\n- **Advanced Mathematical and Computational Skills**:\n  - Take advanced courses or workshops in mathematics and computational methods relevant to Active Inference.\n  - Practice implementing complex models using software tools like PyTorch or TensorFlow.\n\n## Specific Resources\n\n- **Active Inference Institute Materials**:\n  - Access materials and resources provided by the Active Inference community, such as lectures, tutorials, and workshops.\n  - Follow Karl Friston's work and lectures available through various platforms[4].\n\n- **Academic Papers and Tutorials**:\n  - Papers on arXiv, PubMed, and other academic databases related to Active Inference[1][3].\n  - Tutorials and workshops available through Neuromatch Academy and the Computational Psychiatry course[4].\n\n- **Software Tools and Frameworks**:\n  - PyTorch or TensorFlow for implementing Active Inference models.\n  - Use platforms like Hugging Face for accessing pre-built models and community resources[1].\n\n- **Community Resources and Events**:\n  - Participate in online forums, webinars, and conferences related to Active Inference.\n  - Attend workshops like the Computational Neuroscience \u2018Imbizo\u2019 if possible[4].\n\n## Progress Tracking\n\n### Milestones and Checkpoints\n- **Weekly Reading and Note-Taking**:\n  - Set aside dedicated time each week to read and take notes on key papers and resources.\n  - Review notes periodically to reinforce understanding.\n\n- **Monthly Project Progress**:\n  - Set specific project goals and milestones for each month.\n  - Regularly review and adjust the project plan based on progress.\n\n### Self-Assessment Methods\n- **Reflective Journaling**:\n  - Keep a journal to reflect on what has been learned and what challenges have been faced.\n  - Identify areas that need more focus or additional resources.\n\n- **Peer Review and Feedback**:\n  - Share work and progress with peers or mentors to get feedback.\n  - Participate in group discussions to gain insights from others.\n\n### Practical Application Opportunities\n- **Case Studies and Real-World Applications**:\n  - Apply the concepts learned to real-world scenarios or case studies.\n  - Participate in hackathons or coding challenges that involve applying Active Inference to practical problems.\n\nBy following this structured plan, Molly can gradually build her understanding of Active Inference, engage with the community, and apply the concepts to her domain of interest. This plan is flexible enough to adapt to her specific background and learning needs as they become clearer.",
