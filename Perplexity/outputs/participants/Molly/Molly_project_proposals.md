### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Implementing Active Inference in a Simple Robot Navigation Task

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create a simple robot that can navigate to a target location using the Active Inference framework, demonstrating the basics of predictive coding and Bayesian inference in action.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, robot navigation often relies on traditional control systems and machine learning algorithms that may not fully incorporate the principles of Active Inference. These methods can be limited by their lack of integrated perception, learning, and decision-making processes, which can lead to less robust and adaptable navigation systems.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
The new approach involves using the Active Inference framework to frame the navigation task as a Bayesian inference problem. This integrates perception, learning, and decision-making into a single coherent process, allowing the robot to adaptively update its models based on sensory inputs and minimize prediction errors. This method has been shown to be robust and effective in similar projects, such as the one described by the BIASlab[3].

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will demonstrate the feasibility of applying Active Inference to simple robotic tasks, which can be a stepping stone for more complex applications in autonomous systems. It will also provide a practical example for educational purposes, helping others to understand and implement Active Inference.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Technical Challenges**: Integrating Active Inference into a robotic system can be technically demanding, especially for someone new to the field.
- **Resource Limitations**: The project may require specific hardware and software resources that might not be readily available.
- **Time Constraints**: The project's scope and timeline need to be carefully managed to ensure completion within the set timeframe.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The cost will depend on the hardware and software resources needed. For a simple setup, using a Boe-Bot robot and basic sensors, the cost could be relatively low (approximately $500-$1000).

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project can be completed within 1-3 months, depending on the depth of implementation and the participant's familiarity with the technology.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint**: Successful implementation of the basic navigation algorithm using Active Inference, with the robot able to move towards a target location.
- **Final Checkpoint**: The robot's ability to adaptively navigate to the target location despite minor environmental perturbations, and a written report detailing the implementation and results.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Developing an Active Inference Model for Human Decision-Making in Social Contexts

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop an Active Inference model that simulates human decision-making in social contexts, incorporating neuro-bio-social dynamics to predict and understand social behavior.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current models of human decision-making often lack a comprehensive integration of neuro-bio-social factors. Traditional models in psychology and neuroscience tend to focus on either the neural or the social aspects separately, missing the holistic view provided by Active Inference.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
The new approach involves using the Active Inference framework to integrate neuro-bio-social models, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of how humans make decisions in social contexts. This approach leverages Bayesian inference to test predictive models against sensory error streams, which has been shown to be effective in similar research areas[1].

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will provide a novel framework for understanding human decision-making in social contexts, which can be invaluable in fields such as sociology, psychology, and artificial intelligence. It will also contribute to the development of more realistic and adaptive models of human behavior.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Complexity of the Model**: Integrating neuro-bio-social dynamics can be highly complex and requires a deep understanding of multiple disciplines.
- **Data Availability**: Access to relevant data on human social behavior and decision-making might be limited.
- **Validation Challenges**: Validating the model against real-world data and ensuring its predictive power can be challenging.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The cost will primarily be in terms of time and computational resources. Depending on the complexity of the model and the data requirements, additional funding for data collection or computational resources might be necessary (estimated cost: $0 - $5,000).

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take 6-12 months to complete, depending on the depth of the model and the availability of data.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint**: Successful development of the basic Active Inference model for human decision-making, with preliminary simulations indicating the model's feasibility.
- **Final Checkpoint**: Validation of the model against real-world data on social behavior, and a published paper or presentation detailing the model and its implications.

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Building an Active Inference-Based Autonomous Agent for Complex Real-World Tasks

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop an autonomous agent using the Active Inference framework that can perform complex real-world tasks, such as navigation in dynamic environments or interaction with humans, by integrating advanced perception, learning, and decision-making capabilities.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current autonomous agents often rely on fragmented approaches to perception, learning, and decision-making, which can lead to brittle performance in dynamic or unpredictable environments. These agents lack the integrated and adaptive nature provided by the Active Inference framework.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
The new approach involves using the Active Inference framework to create an autonomous agent that integrates all tasks (perception, learning, decision-making) into a single Bayesian inference process. This allows the agent to adaptively update its models and minimize prediction errors in real-time, making it more robust and flexible in complex environments[3].

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will revolutionize the field of autonomous systems by providing agents that can adaptively navigate and interact within dynamic real-world environments. This will have significant implications for robotics, artificial intelligence, and various industrial applications.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Technical Complexity**: The project involves significant technical challenges, including advanced sensor integration, complex Bayesian modeling, and real-time processing.
- **Resource Intensive**: The project will require substantial computational resources, advanced hardware, and possibly a team of specialists.
- **Validation and Testing**: Ensuring the agent's safety and efficacy in real-world scenarios will be a major challenge.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The cost will be substantial, potentially involving funding for advanced hardware, software, and a team of researchers (estimated cost: $50,000 - $200,000 or more).

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take 1-3 years to complete, depending on the complexity of the tasks and the resources available.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint**: Successful development of the core Active Inference model and initial simulations indicating the agent's feasibility in controlled environments.
- **Final Checkpoint**: Deployment and validation of the autonomous agent in real-world scenarios, with a comprehensive report detailing the implementation, results, and implications for future research and applications.
