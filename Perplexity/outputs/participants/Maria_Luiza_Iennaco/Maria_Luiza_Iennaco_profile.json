She is currently a PhD student in the same field at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo[2][4].\n- **Professional Experience**: Iennaco has experience as a Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) therapist, research assistant, and has held various roles in education, marketing, and human resources. Her research experience includes working on projects related to smoking cessation, computerized interventions, and philosophical models of consciousness[2].\n- **Affiliations**: She is a member of the Active Inference Institute and has been involved in several research assistant roles, including at the Active Inference Lab[2][4].\n\nWhile her background in psychology and philosophy provides a strong foundation for understanding the theoretical aspects of Active Inference, her lack of extensive mathematical training is acknowledged as a limitation.\n\n### Active Inference Journey: Current Understanding and Application Stage\n\nIennaco's journey with Active Inference is marked by a deep philosophical engagement with the framework.\n\n- **Current Understanding**: Her master's work focused on the interrelation between Dennett's Multiple Drafts Model and Predictive Processing, which laid the groundwork for her current PhD project. She is now exploring the role of attention in perception and consciousness using Active Inference, which she sees as an extension of Predictive Processing[4].\n- **Application Stage**: Iennaco aims to apply scale-free Active Inference to provide a robust description of attention, encompassing multiple processes and mechanisms. While her approach is primarily philosophical, she expresses an interest in potential empirical applications if she finds suitable collaborators[4].\n\nHer current stage is characterized by a strong theoretical grasp but a recognition of the need for deeper mathematical understanding to fully engage with the empirical aspects of Active Inference.\n\n### Learning Path: Specific Needs and Potential Resources\n\nIennaco identifies several learning needs to advance her work in Active Inference:\n\n- **Mathematical Training**: The primary challenge she faces is the lack of mathematical knowledge, which she acknowledges is necessary for a complete understanding of Active Inference. Setting aside time to learn and simulate Active Inference basic models is her stated goal[4].\n- **Resources**: To address this, she could benefit from resources such as:\n  - Mathematical courses or workshops focused on variational inference and free energy principles.\n  - Collaborations with researchers who have a strong mathematical background in Active Inference.\n  - Utilizing online resources, such as tutorials and research papers, that provide a mathematical introduction to Active Inference[5].\n\n### Collaboration Potential: Possible Synergies with Other Participants/Presenters\n\nIennaco's interdisciplinary background and current research focus make her a valuable potential collaborator.\n\n- **Synergies**: Her work on attention and consciousness using Active Inference could align well with researchers from neuroscience, philosophy, and cognitive science. Collaborations could enhance her mathematical understanding and provide empirical validation for her philosophical interpretations.\n- **Potential Collaborators**: Researchers like Beren Millidge, Alexander Tschantz, Anil K Seth, and Christopher L Buckley, who have published work on the theoretical and mathematical aspects of Active Inference, could be valuable collaborators[5].\n\n### Challenges & Opportunities: Personal and Field-Wide Perspectives\n\n#### Personal Challenges\n\n- **Mathematical Knowledge**: The most significant personal challenge Iennaco faces is acquiring the necessary mathematical skills to fully engage with Active Inference.\n- **Interdisciplinarity**: Maintaining an interdisciplinary approach without specializing too narrowly is another challenge she highlights[4].\n\n#### Field-Wide Challenges and Opportunities\n\n- **Interdisciplinary Integration**: One of the broader challenges in the field of Active Inference is integrating insights from multiple disciplines (e.g., neuroscience, philosophy, mathematics) without losing focus on the core principles of the framework.\n- **Empirical Validation**: There is an opportunity for empirical studies to validate the philosophical and theoretical models of Active Inference, which could be facilitated by collaborations between theorists and empiricists.\n- **Cross-Disciplinary Synergies**: The field stands to benefit from synergies between different research groups and disciplines, which can help in overcoming the challenges of interdisciplinarity and in developing more comprehensive models of cognition and behavior[1][5].\n\nIn summary, Maria Luiza Iennaco's profile reflects a strong theoretical foundation in Active Inference, with clear personal and field-wide challenges and opportunities. Addressing the mathematical gap and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations are key steps for her and the broader community to advance in this field.",
