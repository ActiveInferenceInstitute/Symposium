### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Implementing Basic Active Inference Models for Attention Studies

**1. What are you trying to do?**
- Develop and implement simple Active Inference models to simulate attention processes, using Python or MATLAB, to gain a practical understanding of the framework.

**2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**
- Currently, Active Inference models are often implemented by researchers with a strong mathematical background, which can be a barrier for those with less mathematical expertise. The limits include the complexity of the models and the need for advanced coding skills.

**3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?**
- This project will use existing resources such as the Neuromatch Academy materials and online tutorials to simplify the implementation process. By starting with basic models, the approach will be more accessible and help build foundational skills. Success will be measured by the ability to simulate and understand basic attention processes using Active Inference.

**4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?**
- Success in this project will help Maria Luiza Iennaco develop the necessary skills to apply Active Inference to attention studies, contributing to a better understanding of attention mechanisms. This will also make her a more competitive researcher in the field.

**5. What are the risks?**
- The primary risk is the initial difficulty in grasping the mathematical concepts and coding requirements, which could lead to frustration and slower progress.

**6. How much will it cost?**
- This project will utilize free or low-cost resources such as online tutorials, open-source software (e.g., PyTorch, MATLAB), and academic papers, minimizing costs.

**7. How long will it take?**
- This project is expected to take approximately 1-3 months, depending on the pace of learning and implementation.

**8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?**
- **Week 1-2:** Complete reading introductory materials and join online forums.
- **Month 1:** Implement a simple Active Inference model using Python or MATLAB.
- **Month 3:** Present a small-scale simulation demonstrating the basic principles of Active Inference in attention studies.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Empirical Application of Scale-Free Active Inference to Attention

**1. What are you trying to do?**
- Design and conduct an empirical study applying scale-free Active Inference to understand attention mechanisms, integrating both theoretical and empirical aspects.

**2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**
- Current studies often use simplified models or focus solely on theoretical aspects. The limits include the lack of integration between empirical data and theoretical models, and the complexity of scale-free systems.

**3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?**
- This project will collaborate with researchers from neuroscience and psychology to collect and analyze empirical data (e.g., fMRI, EEG) and apply scale-free Active Inference models. The interdisciplinary approach and use of advanced computational tools (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow) will enhance the accuracy and applicability of the models. Success will be measured by the ability to predict and explain attention-related behaviors using empirical data.

**4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?**
- Success will contribute significantly to the understanding of attention mechanisms, providing insights that could be applied in clinical and cognitive psychology settings. It will also advance the field of Active Inference by demonstrating its empirical validity.

**5. What are the risks?**
- Risks include the complexity of integrating empirical data with theoretical models, potential issues with data quality, and the need for significant computational resources.

**6. How much will it cost?**
- This project may require funding for data collection equipment (e.g., fMRI, EEG), software licenses, and potentially collaborating with researchers from other institutions. Estimated costs could range from $5,000 to $20,000, depending on the scope and resources needed.

**7. How long will it take?**
- This project is expected to take approximately 6-12 months, considering the time needed for data collection, analysis, and model implementation.

**8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?**
- **Month 3:** Complete the design of the empirical study and obtain necessary approvals.
- **Month 6:** Collect and analyze the empirical data.
- **Month 12:** Present the findings in a research paper or conference, demonstrating the application of scale-free Active Inference to attention studies.

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing a Comprehensive Framework for Attention Using Active Inference

**1. What are you trying to do?**
- Develop a comprehensive and integrated framework for understanding attention using Active Inference, encompassing multiple scales and processes, and validating it through a combination of theoretical modeling and empirical studies.

**2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**
- Current frameworks for attention are often fragmented, lacking a unified theoretical basis. The limits include the absence of a scale-free approach that integrates various attention processes and the lack of empirical validation across different scales.

**3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?**
- This project will involve a multi-year effort to develop a scale-free Active Inference framework that integrates attention processes from neural to behavioral levels. It will utilize advanced computational models, collaborate with researchers from multiple disciplines (neuroscience, psychology, mathematics), and conduct extensive empirical validation. Success will be measured by the ability to predict and explain a wide range of attention-related phenomena across different scales.

**4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?**
- Success will revolutionize the understanding of attention, providing a unified theoretical framework that can be applied in various fields such as psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. It will also significantly advance the field of Active Inference by demonstrating its applicability to complex cognitive processes.

**5. What are the risks?**
- Risks include the complexity of the project, the need for long-term commitment and resources, potential challenges in integrating diverse datasets, and the risk of not achieving the desired level of empirical validation.

**6. How much will it cost?**
- This project will require substantial funding for multi-year research, potentially involving multiple researchers, advanced computational resources, and extensive data collection. Estimated costs could range from $100,000 to $500,000 or more.

**7. How long will it take?**
- This project is expected to take approximately 2-5 years, considering the scope, complexity, and the need for extensive empirical validation.

**8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?**
- **Year 1:** Complete the theoretical framework and initial simulations.
- **Year 2:** Conduct pilot empirical studies to validate key aspects of the framework.
- **Year 3-4:** Collect and analyze extensive empirical data across different scales.
- **Year 5:** Present the comprehensive framework in a series of research papers and conferences, demonstrating its applicability and validity in understanding attention mechanisms.

Each of these proposals aligns with Maria Luiza Iennaco's background, interests, and learning plan, providing a structured path to advance her research in Active Inference and attention studies.
