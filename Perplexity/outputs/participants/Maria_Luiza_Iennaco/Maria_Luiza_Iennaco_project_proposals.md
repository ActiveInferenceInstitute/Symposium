### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Simulating Basic Active Inference Models

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create and simulate basic Active Inference models to understand the fundamental principles of Active Inference, particularly in the context of perception and action.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, researchers use various software tools like MATLAB or Python libraries (e.g., `spmPy`) to simulate Active Inference models. However, for those without extensive mathematical backgrounds, like Maria Luiza Iennaco, the initial barrier to entry is high due to the complexity of the mathematical concepts involved.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will start with a simplified approach using introductory tutorials and resources from the Active Inference Institute. Iennaco will focus on implementing basic models using `spmPy` or MATLAB, beginning with simple perception and action scenarios. This approach will be supported by regular engagement with online forums and community discussions to clarify any doubts and receive feedback.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will enable Iennaco to gain a practical understanding of Active Inference, bridging the gap between her theoretical knowledge and the ability to simulate and analyze models. This will enhance her capability to contribute to and engage with the broader Active Inference community.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risk is the potential difficulty in grasping the mathematical concepts quickly, which could slow down the learning process. Additionally, there is a risk of misinterpreting the results of the simulations without proper guidance.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will primarily rely on free or low-cost resources such as online tutorials, community forums, and open-source software tools like `spmPy`. Therefore, the financial cost is minimal.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take 1-2 months to complete, depending on the pace of learning and the complexity of the models simulated.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Week 1-2:** Complete introductory tutorials and set up the necessary software tools.
- **Month 1:** Successfully simulate basic Active Inference models and understand the output.
- **Month 2:** Present the simulations and results to the community or a mentor for feedback.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Applying Active Inference to Attentional Mechanisms

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a research project that applies Active Inference to understand attentional mechanisms in perception, integrating both theoretical and empirical approaches.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current research on attention often lacks a unified theoretical framework that integrates multiple processes and mechanisms. Active Inference offers a promising approach but requires a deeper mathematical understanding and empirical validation.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will leverage Iennaco's background in psychology and philosophy to critically review current theories of attention and then apply Active Inference principles to model attentional mechanisms. The approach will involve:
- A thorough literature review on attention and its current theoretical models.
- Development of Active Inference models to simulate attentional processes.
- Collaboration with neuroscientists or psychologists to design and conduct empirical studies to validate the models.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will provide a robust, theoretically grounded description of attention using Active Inference, contributing to a better understanding of attentional mechanisms. This could have significant implications for fields such as neuroscience, psychology, and cognitive science.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The risks include the complexity of integrating theoretical models with empirical data, potential difficulties in collaborating with researchers from different disciplines, and the challenge of validating the models empirically.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project may require some funding for software tools, data collection, and potentially collaborating with other researchers. However, the cost can be managed by leveraging university resources, grants, or collaborations with institutions.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take 3-6 months to complete, depending on the scope of the empirical studies and the complexity of the models developed.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Month 1-2:** Complete the literature review and develop a preliminary Active Inference model for attention.
- **Month 3-4:** Design and initiate empirical studies to validate the model.
- **Month 5-6:** Analyze the data, refine the model, and prepare a research paper for submission.

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing Scale-Free Active Inference Models for Consciousness

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and apply scale-free Active Inference models to explain the emergence, development, and configuration of consciousness, integrating insights from philosophy, neuroscience, and mathematics.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current models of consciousness often lack a unified, scale-free framework that can explain the complex, hierarchical nature of conscious experience. Active Inference offers a promising approach but requires significant theoretical and empirical development.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will build on Iennaco's PhD work on attention and Active Inference by extending the framework to consciousness. The approach will involve:
- A comprehensive review of current theories of consciousness and their limitations.
- Development of scale-free Active Inference models that can capture the hierarchical and integrated nature of conscious experience.
- Collaboration with researchers from neuroscience, philosophy, and mathematics to ensure a multidisciplinary approach.
- Empirical validation through neuroimaging studies or other experimental methods.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project could provide a groundbreaking, theoretically robust description of consciousness, integrating multiple disciplines and offering new insights into the nature of conscious experience. This could have profound implications for fields such as neuroscience, philosophy of mind, and cognitive science.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The risks include the high complexity of the task, potential difficulties in integrating insights from multiple disciplines, and the challenge of empirically validating such a comprehensive model.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will likely require significant funding for research personnel, data collection, and potentially advanced computational resources. Securing grants or collaborations with well-funded institutions will be crucial.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take 1-2 years to complete, depending on the scope of the research, the complexity of the models developed, and the time required for empirical validation.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Year 1:** Complete the literature review, develop a preliminary scale-free Active Inference model, and design empirical studies.
- **Year 1.5:** Initiate and complete data collection for empirical studies.
- **Year 2:** Analyze the data, refine the model, and prepare a comprehensive research paper or book for publication.
- **Final Check Point:** Present the findings at major conferences and submit the research for peer review.
