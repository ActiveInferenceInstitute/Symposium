### Personalized Learning Plan for Maria Luiza Iennaco: Active Inference

#### Immediate Next Steps (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Mathematical Introduction to Active Inference:**
  - Start with the tutorial by Karl Friston on "Active Inference: Free Energy and the Brain" which provides a foundational mathematical overview[5].
  - Utilize the resources from the Active Inference Institute, such as introductory lectures and tutorials, to get a grasp of the basic concepts[5].

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the basic mathematical principles of Active Inference, including variational inference and free energy.
- Familiarize yourself with the key concepts of Predictive Processing and how they relate to Active Inference.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Allocate 2 hours daily to watch and take notes on introductory tutorials.
- Begin reading the paper "Active inference and learning" to understand the distinction between goal-directed and habitual behavior[3].
- Join online forums or discussion groups related to Active Inference (e.g., the Active Inference Lab's community) to ask questions and engage with others in the field.

#### Short-Term Goals (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Variational Inference:** Understand the mathematical underpinnings of variational inference and its application in Active Inference.
- **Free Energy Principle:** Learn how the free energy principle is used in Active Inference to explain perception and action.
- **Epistemic and Pragmatic Value:** Understand the roles of epistemic (ambiguity-resolving) and pragmatic (reward-seeking) behaviors in Active Inference.

**Practical Exercises or Projects:**
- Implement simple Active Inference models using software tools like MATLAB or Python libraries such as `spmPy` (a Python wrapper for SPM software, commonly used in Active Inference research).
- Use the `spmPy` library to simulate basic Active Inference scenarios, such as perception and action in simple environments.

**Recommended Study Materials:**
- **Books:**
  - "The Free-Energy Principle: A Unified Brain Theory?" by Karl Friston[5].
- **Papers:**
  - "Active inference and learning" by Friston et al.[3].
  - "Learning in Hybrid Active Inference Models" for insights into advanced applications[5].
- **Online Courses:**
  - Look for online courses or workshops on Bayesian inference and variational methods, such as those offered on platforms like Coursera or edX.

**Community Engagement Opportunities:**
- Attend webinars or online seminars hosted by the Active Inference Institute.
- Participate in discussions on the Active Inference Lab's community forum or social media groups.
- Reach out to potential collaborators like Beren Millidge, Alexander Tschantz, or Anil K Seth for guidance and feedback.

#### Medium-Term Development (3-6 months)

**Advanced Topics to Explore:**
- **Scale-Free Active Inference:** Delve deeper into the application of scale-free Active Inference in describing attention and consciousness.
- **Hybrid Active Inference Models:** Study the integration of discrete and continuous variables in decision-making as outlined in "Learning in Hybrid Active Inference Models"[5].

**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**
- Collaborate with researchers from the Active Inference Institute on empirical projects that apply Active Inference to attention and consciousness.
- Join interdisciplinary research groups that combine neuroscience, philosophy, and mathematics to tackle complex problems in cognition and behavior.

**Application Projects in Their Domain:**
- Develop a project that applies Active Inference to understanding attentional mechanisms in perception, using both theoretical and empirical approaches.
- Use the insights from Hybrid Active Inference Models to design experiments that test the role of attention in consciousness.

**Skill-Building Activities:**
- Participate in coding challenges or hackathons focused on machine learning and Bayesian inference.
- Write and submit a research paper to a journal or conference on the application of Active Inference in attention and consciousness.
