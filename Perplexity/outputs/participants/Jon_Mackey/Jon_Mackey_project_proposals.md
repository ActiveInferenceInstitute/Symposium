### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Developing a Simplified Active Inference Tutorial

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create a simplified tutorial or workshop to help beginners, including PhD candidates like Jon Mackey, understand the basic principles of Active Inference without getting overwhelmed by the complex mathematical and theoretical frameworks.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, resources on Active Inference are often highly technical and geared towards advanced researchers. This limits accessibility for those new to the field, such as PhD candidates, who may struggle to apply the theories in practical settings like sport coaching.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will involve creating a step-by-step, jargon-free tutorial that breaks down the core concepts of Active Inference into manageable parts. It will include interactive simulations, case studies, and practical exercises tailored to the needs of sport coaches and skill acquisition researchers. The tutorial will be developed in collaboration with experts in the field, such as Sonny Sahota, to ensure both theoretical accuracy and practical relevance.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will make Active Inference more accessible to a broader audience, including sport coaches, skill acquisition researchers, and PhD candidates. This will facilitate the integration of Active Inference into various practical domains, potentially leading to innovative coaching methods and improved athlete performance.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the difficulty in simplifying complex theories without losing their essence, the need for continuous feedback and validation from experts, and the challenge of engaging a broad audience.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The costs will be relatively low, primarily involving time and effort from the project team. Potential costs could include:
- Software and simulation tools
- Collaboration fees for experts
- Hosting and maintenance of the tutorial online

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project can be completed within 1-2 months, depending on the complexity of the content and the availability of collaborators.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Weekly Checkpoints:** Regular meetings with the project team to review progress and address any challenges.
- **Mid-Term Review (1 month):** Conduct a preliminary review of the tutorial content to ensure it meets the objectives and gather initial feedback from a small group of testers.
- **Final Review (2 months):** Launch the tutorial and gather comprehensive feedback from a larger audience to make any necessary adjustments.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Designing and Implementing Active Inference-Based Training Programs

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Design, implement, and evaluate training programs for athletes using the principles of Active Inference to optimize performance and learning.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, training programs in sports often rely on traditional methods that may not fully leverage the latest advancements in cognitive science and control theory. These methods can be less personalized and less adaptive to the athlete's learning process.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will use Active Inference to develop predictive models that can adapt to an athlete's performance and learning patterns. The approach will involve:
- Collaborating with coaches and athletes to gather data on performance and learning.
- Using Bayesian inference and control theory to create personalized training plans.
- Implementing and testing these plans in real-world coaching settings.
- Evaluating the effectiveness of the programs through both quantitative and qualitative feedback.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will lead to more effective, personalized, and adaptive training programs that can significantly improve athlete performance. This could have a substantial impact on the field of sport coaching, enhancing both the efficiency and efficacy of training methods.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of integrating Active Inference into existing coaching practices, the need for robust data collection and analysis, and the potential resistance from traditional coaches to adopt new methodologies.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The costs will include:
- Data collection and analysis tools
- Software for implementing Bayesian models and simulations
- Collaboration fees for coaches and experts
- Potential travel costs for on-site evaluations

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take around 3-6 months, including data collection, model development, implementation, and evaluation.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Monthly Checkpoints:** Regular reviews of data collection progress and model development.
- **Mid-Term Review (3 months):** Initial implementation of the training programs with a small group of athletes to gather preliminary feedback.
- **Final Review (6 months):** Comprehensive evaluation of the training programs with a larger group of athletes, including both quantitative and qualitative feedback.

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing an Integrated Active Inference Framework for Interdisciplinary Skill Acquisition Research

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a comprehensive, integrated framework that combines Active Inference with other relevant theories (such as ecological dynamics and cognitive neuroscience) to create a holistic approach to skill acquisition research across various disciplines.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, skill acquisition research is often fragmented, with different disciplines using separate theories and methodologies. This fragmentation limits the comprehensive understanding and application of skill acquisition principles.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will involve:
- Conducting a thorough literature review to integrate key concepts from Active Inference, ecological dynamics, and cognitive neuroscience.
- Collaborating with researchers from multiple disciplines (cognitive psychology, neuroscience, control theory) to develop a unified framework.
- Developing advanced Bayesian models and simulation tools to implement and test the framework.
- Applying the framework in various practical settings, such as sport coaching, education, and rehabilitation.

The success of this approach hinges on the interdisciplinary collaboration and the use of advanced computational tools to model and simulate complex learning processes.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will lead to a groundbreaking, integrated framework for understanding and enhancing skill acquisition across multiple disciplines. This could revolutionize the way skills are taught and learned, impacting fields such as sports, education, and healthcare.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of integrating diverse theoretical frameworks, the need for extensive interdisciplinary collaboration, and the challenge of validating the framework through empirical studies.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The costs will be significant and will include:
- Funding for interdisciplinary research collaborations
- Advanced computational tools and software
- Travel and conference costs for international collaborations
- Potential funding for pilot studies and large-scale implementations

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take around 1-2 years, considering the extensive literature review, model development, and empirical validation required.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Quarterly Checkpoints:** Regular reviews of literature and model development progress.
- **Mid-Term Review (6 months):** Preliminary presentation of the integrated framework at a conference or workshop to gather feedback from the academic community.
- **Mid-Term Review (1 year):** Initial pilot studies to test the framework in specific practical settings.
- **Final Review (2 years):** Comprehensive evaluation and publication of the framework, including results from large-scale empirical studies.
