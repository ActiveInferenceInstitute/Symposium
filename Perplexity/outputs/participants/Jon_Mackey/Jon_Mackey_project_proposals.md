### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Simulating Active Inference in Skill Acquisition

**1. What are you trying to do?**
Create a simple simulation to demonstrate how Active Inference can be applied to the process of skill acquisition in sports, specifically focusing on the decision-making and learning aspects of athletes.

**2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**
Currently, skill acquisition in sports is often analyzed using traditional coaching methods and psychological theories that may not fully account for the dynamic and uncertain nature of athletic performance. These methods lack a unified framework that integrates decision-making, learning, and adaptation under uncertainty.

**3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?**
This project will utilize Active Inference to model how athletes make decisions and learn new skills. By using Bayesian inference and control theory, the simulation will capture the dynamic interaction between the athlete's internal models and the external environment. This approach is new because it integrates a theoretical framework that can predict and explain the adaptive behavior of athletes in a more comprehensive and quantitative manner.

**4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?**
Coaches, athletes, and sports scientists will benefit from this simulation as it provides a more nuanced understanding of the skill acquisition process. It can help in designing more effective coaching strategies and improving athlete performance by better understanding how athletes learn and adapt.

**5. What are the risks?**
The main risk is the complexity of the mathematical models involved in Active Inference, which might be challenging to implement accurately. Additionally, the simplicity of the simulation might not fully capture the complexity of real-world scenarios.

**6. How much will it cost?**
The project will primarily require computational resources (e.g., a computer with MATLAB or Python) and access to relevant literature and online resources, which are likely already available.

**7. How long will it take?**
This project can be completed within 1-2 months, depending on the depth of the simulation and the amount of time dedicated to it each week.

**8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?**
- **Mid-term Check Point:** After 4 weeks, evaluate the initial simulation results and ensure that the basic principles of Active Inference are correctly implemented.
- **Final Check Point:** After 8 weeks, complete the simulation, analyze the results, and write a short report detailing the findings and implications for coaching strategies.

**Potential Collaborators or Resources:**
- Collaborate with other researchers or students interested in Active Inference.
- Utilize resources from the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging and online forums dedicated to Active Inference.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Developing Active Inference-Based Coaching Strategies

**1. What are you trying to do?**
Develop and implement coaching strategies for athletes based on the principles of Active Inference, focusing on improving decision-making and learning under uncertainty.

**2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**
Currently, coaching strategies are often based on empirical methods and traditional psychological theories that do not fully incorporate the dynamic and adaptive nature of athletic performance. These methods lack a systematic approach to understanding how athletes make decisions and learn new skills.

**3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?**
This project will apply Active Inference to design coaching strategies that explicitly model the athlete's internal models and their interaction with the environment. By using Bayesian inference and control theory, these strategies will be more adaptive and responsive to the athlete's needs, leading to more effective skill acquisition and performance improvement.

**4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?**
Coaches, athletes, and sports organizations will benefit from these strategies as they can lead to improved performance, faster skill acquisition, and better decision-making under pressure.

**5. What are the risks?**
The main risks include the complexity of translating theoretical models into practical coaching strategies and the potential resistance from coaches and athletes to adopt new methodologies.

**6. How much will it cost?**
The project may require some funding for data collection tools, software, and potential collaboration with other experts. However, the primary costs will be in terms of time and effort.

**7. How long will it take?**
This project can be completed within 3-6 months, depending on the scope of the strategies and the amount of data collected.

**8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?**
- **Mid-term Check Point:** After 3 months, evaluate the initial coaching strategies and gather feedback from athletes and coaches.
- **Final Check Point:** After 6 months, complete the implementation, collect and analyze data on the effectiveness of the strategies, and write a comprehensive report.

**Potential Collaborators or Resources:**
- Collaborate with coaches and athletes from various sports.
- Utilize resources from sports science departments and the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging.
- Engage with online forums and discussion groups focused on Active Inference and sports coaching.

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Integrating Active Inference with Interdisciplinary Research in Elite Performance

**1. What are you trying to do?**
Conduct an interdisciplinary research project integrating Active Inference with psychology, neuroscience, and computer science to develop a comprehensive framework for understanding and enhancing elite athletic performance.

**2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**
Current research in elite athletic performance often involves fragmented approaches from different disciplines without a unified theoretical framework. This lack of integration limits the depth and breadth of understanding how athletes perform and adapt.

**3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?**
This project will integrate Active Inference with insights from psychology, neuroscience, and computer science to create a holistic model of athletic performance. By combining Bayesian inference, control theory, and advanced data analysis techniques, the project will provide a more complete understanding of how athletes make decisions, learn, and adapt under uncertainty.

**4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?**
This project will have significant implications for sports science, coaching practices, and athlete development. It can lead to the development of more effective training programs, better decision-making strategies, and enhanced overall performance.

**5. What are the risks?**
The main risks include the complexity of integrating multiple disciplines, the need for significant resources (time, funding, collaborators), and the potential for resistance to new methodologies.

**6. How much will it cost?**
The project will likely require substantial funding for data collection, software, and collaboration with experts from various fields.

**7. How long will it take?**
This project can span 1-2 years, depending on the scope and the complexity of the research.

**8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?**
- **Mid-term Check Point:** After 6 months, evaluate the progress of the interdisciplinary collaboration and the initial results of the integrated model.
- **Mid-term Check Point:** After 1 year, complete the data collection and initial analysis, and present preliminary findings at a conference or workshop.
- **Final Check Point:** After 2 years, complete the final analysis, write and publish a research paper, and present the findings at a major conference.

**Potential Collaborators or Resources:**
- Collaborate with researchers from psychology, neuroscience, and computer science departments.
- Utilize resources from the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, sports science departments, and relevant academic journals.
- Engage with international conferences and workshops focused on Active Inference and sports science.
