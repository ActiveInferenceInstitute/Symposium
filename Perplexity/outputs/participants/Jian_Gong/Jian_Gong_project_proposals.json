What are you trying to do?\nThe objective is to apply Active Inference to model and predict the behavior of simple biological systems, such as the growth patterns of microorganisms, using a hierarchical generative model.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrently, modeling biological systems often relies on traditional statistical models or simple machine learning approaches. These methods can be limited by their inability to handle complex, hierarchical data and to incorporate feedback loops between the system and its environment. They also may not optimize for the minimization of free energy, a key principle in Active Inference.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project introduces the use of Active Inference, which leverages hierarchical generative models and the free energy principle to better capture the complex interactions within biological systems. By using Active Inference, we can model the system's internal states and its interactions with the environment in a more integrated and dynamic way, potentially leading to more accurate predictions and a deeper understanding of the system's behavior.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nSuccess in this project will provide a proof-of-concept for applying Active Inference in biological modeling, which could be particularly valuable in fields like astrobiology and geobiology. It will demonstrate the potential of Active Inference to improve our understanding of simple biological systems and could pave the way for more complex applications in the future.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\nThe main risks include the steep learning curve associated with Active Inference, potential difficulties in adapting the framework to biological data, and the possibility that the model may not perform better than existing methods.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThis project will primarily require computational resources and access to existing software tools like `spm_py`. There are no significant financial costs anticipated beyond what is already available.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\nThis project is expected to take approximately 1-3 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the model and the availability of data.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Mid-term Check Point**: Successful implementation of a basic Active Inference model using `spm_py` and initial results showing the model's ability to predict simple biological behaviors.\n- **Final Check Point**: Completion of the model, validation against real data, and a written report detailing the findings and implications.\n\n**Potential Collaborators/Resources:**\n- Collaborate with researchers at the SETI Institute or NASA who have experience in applying advanced computational methods in astrobiology.\n- Utilize resources from the Friston lab, including tutorials and software tools.\n\n### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with Environmental Modeling for Astrobiological Research\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nThe objective is to integrate Active Inference with environmental modeling to predict and optimize the conditions for life in various planetary environments, leveraging Dr. Gong's expertise in astrobiology and geobiology.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrent methods for modeling planetary environments and searching for life often rely on static models and do not fully account for the dynamic interactions between the environment and potential biological systems. These models can be limited in their ability to predict complex behaviors and optimize conditions for life.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project will use Active Inference to create dynamic, hierarchical models that integrate environmental and biological data. By minimizing free energy, these models can predict and optimize the conditions necessary for life to emerge and sustain itself, providing a more comprehensive and dynamic approach than current methods.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nSuccess in this project will significantly impact the field of astrobiology by providing new tools for predicting and identifying potential habitats for life beyond Earth. It will also contribute to the development of more efficient and effective strategies for future planetary missions.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\nThe risks include the complexity of integrating Active Inference with existing environmental models, the need for high-quality and diverse datasets, and the potential for the models to be overly complex or difficult to interpret.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThis project will require access to computational resources, potentially some funding for data acquisition or collaboration with other researchers, and may involve costs associated with attending relevant workshops or conferences.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\nThis project is expected to take approximately 6-9 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the integration and the availability of data.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Mid-term Check Point**: Successful integration of Active Inference with a basic environmental model, with initial results showing the model's ability to predict environmental conditions conducive to life.\n- **Final Check Point**: Completion of the integrated model, validation against real data from planetary environments, and a written report detailing the findings and implications.\n\n**Potential Collaborators/Resources:**\n- Collaborate with environmental modelers and astrobiologists at NASA or the SETI Institute.\n- Utilize datasets from planetary missions and environmental studies.\n- Participate in workshops and conferences focused on astrobiology and environmental modeling.\n\n### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing an Active Inference Framework for Detecting Life Beyond Earth\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nThe objective is to develop a comprehensive Active Inference framework for detecting life beyond Earth, integrating data from multiple sources such as planetary environments, biological markers, and spacecraft observations.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrent methods for detecting life beyond Earth often rely on isolated indicators such as biosignatures or environmental conditions. These methods can be limited by their lack of integration and their inability to handle complex, dynamic data.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project will use Active Inference to create a unified framework that integrates hierarchical generative models with data from various sources. By minimizing free energy, the framework will predict and optimize the detection of life based on a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between the environment and potential biological systems.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nSuccess in this project will revolutionize the field of astrobiology by providing a robust and integrated framework for detecting life beyond Earth. It will significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of future planetary missions and could lead to groundbreaking discoveries.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\nThe risks include the high complexity of the project, the need for extensive and diverse datasets, potential challenges in interpreting the results, and the possibility that the framework may not outperform existing methods.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThis project will require significant computational resources, funding for data acquisition, collaboration with multiple research teams, and potentially costs associated with attending and organizing workshops or conferences.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\nThis project is expected to take approximately 1-2 years to complete, depending on the complexity of the framework and the availability of data.\n\n#### 8.
