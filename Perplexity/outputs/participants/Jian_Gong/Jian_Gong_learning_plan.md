  - Review the section on "The active inference framework" in the paper "Consciousness in active inference" to get a comprehensive overview[5].
- **Engage with Online Communities**:
  - Join online forums or discussion groups focused on Active Inference, such as the Active Inference subreddit or relevant groups on LinkedIn.
- **Set Up a Personal Learning Log**:
  - Create a log or journal to track your progress, note key concepts, and reflect on what you've learned.

### Short-Term Goals (1-3 months)

#### Key Concepts to Master
