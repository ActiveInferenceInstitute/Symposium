### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Applying Active Inference to Biosignature Detection

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
The objective is to apply Active Inference principles to improve the detection and interpretation of biosignatures in astrobiological data. This project aims to develop a simple Active Inference model to enhance the accuracy of identifying potential biological signals in environmental data.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, biosignature detection relies heavily on statistical and machine learning methods that may not fully capture the complexity and variability of biological systems. These methods often lack a unified framework for integrating multiple types of data and can be limited by their inability to handle high-dimensional datasets efficiently.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This approach introduces Active Inference, which provides a unified framework for inference and learning based on the Free-Energy Principle. By using Active Inference, the model can optimize its internal representation of the environment to minimize surprise, potentially leading to more robust and accurate biosignature detection. The use of Bayesian inference and model-based learning in Active Inference can handle complex and high-dimensional data more effectively.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will significantly impact astrobiology and the search for life beyond Earth. Improved biosignature detection methods will enhance the accuracy and efficiency of NASA-sponsored missions, allowing for better interpretation of environmental data and potentially leading to the discovery of life in other planetary systems.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risks include the learning curve associated with adopting a new theoretical framework, the potential for overfitting or underfitting the model, and the need for significant computational resources to handle complex datasets.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require minimal additional funding beyond the existing resources, primarily focusing on software tools and computational resources already available.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- **Immediate Next Steps (1-2 weeks):** Gain a basic understanding of Active Inference principles and identify key resources.
- **Short-Term Goals (1-3 months):** Develop and test a simple Active Inference model using existing datasets.
- **Project Completion:** 3-6 months, including validation and refinement of the model.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint:** After 2 months, evaluate the performance of the initial model on a subset of the data.
- **Final Checkpoint:** After 6 months, present the final model and its performance on a full dataset, including a comparison with current methods.

**Resources and Collaborators:**
- Collaborate with researchers from the Active Inference community.
- Use software tools like MATLAB `spm` toolbox or Python `active_inference` library.
- Utilize existing datasets from NASA-sponsored missions.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with Machine Learning for Environmental Characterization

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
The goal is to integrate Active Inference with machine learning techniques to enhance environmental characterization in astrobiological contexts. This project aims to develop a hybrid model that leverages the strengths of both Active Inference and machine learning to improve the analysis of complex environmental data.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current methods in environmental characterization often rely on separate applications of machine learning and statistical analysis. These approaches can be fragmented, lacking a unified framework that integrates inference and learning processes.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project combines Active Inference, which optimizes internal models to minimize free energy, with machine learning techniques, such as deep learning, to create a robust and adaptive model. This hybrid approach can handle complex datasets more effectively and provide a more comprehensive understanding of environmental-biological interactions.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will significantly enhance the field of astrobiology by providing more accurate and comprehensive environmental characterizations. This will aid in better mission planning, data analysis, and the interpretation of biosignatures, ultimately contributing to the search for life beyond Earth.

#### 5. What are the risks?
Risks include the complexity of integrating two different theoretical frameworks, the potential for overfitting, and the need for substantial computational resources. Additionally, there is a risk of encountering interoperability issues between different software tools.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project may require additional funding for computational resources and potentially for collaborating with experts in machine learning and Active Inference.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- **Short-Term Goals (1-3 months):** Develop a basic understanding of both Active Inference and machine learning techniques.
- **Medium-Term Development (3-6 months):** Integrate Active Inference with machine learning models and test on initial datasets.
- **Project Completion:** 6-12 months, including full-scale testing and validation.
