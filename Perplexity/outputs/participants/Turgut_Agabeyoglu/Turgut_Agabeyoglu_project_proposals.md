### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Simulating Reading and Eye Movements Using Active Inference

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
You are trying to simulate how people read and move their eyes during reading using the principles of Active Inference. The goal is to understand how the brain processes linguistic information and how this process might differ in individuals with dyslexia.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, simulations of reading and eye movements often use simpler models that do not fully capture the complexities of human cognition. These models may not account for the hierarchical inference and generative models that are central to Active Inference. The limits include a lack of integration with large language models and insufficient consideration of neural noise and linguistic complexity.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
Your approach integrates Active Inference with large language models to simulate reading and eye movements. This involves using probabilistic generative models to predict eye movements and linguistic processing, which is a more comprehensive and realistic approach. The success of this approach hinges on the ability of Active Inference to capture the epistemic (ambiguity-resolving) and pragmatic (reward-seeking) aspects of behavior, as well as its ability to model hierarchical inference processes.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Researchers in cognitive science, neuroscience, and linguistics will be interested in this work. Success in this project could lead to a better understanding of how the brain processes language, which could have implications for the diagnosis and treatment of reading disorders like dyslexia.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of implementing Active Inference models, the need for significant computational resources, and the challenge of validating the model against empirical data.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project will primarily require access to computational resources and software tools like MATLAB or Python libraries (e.g., SPM). There may be some costs associated with attending relevant workshops or conferences, but these can be minimal.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take around 1-3 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the simulation and the availability of resources.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point:** After one month, evaluate the initial simulation results and compare them with existing literature. Ensure that the generative models are correctly implemented and that the simulation captures the basic aspects of reading and eye movements.
- **Final Check Point:** After three months, validate the final simulation against empirical data on reading and eye movements in both typical and dyslexic individuals. Present the findings in a report or a short paper.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Modeling Human Translation Processes Using Active Inference

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
You aim to develop a model of human translation processes using Active Inference. The goal is to simulate how translators switch between languages and maintain context during the translation process.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current models of translation often rely on machine learning algorithms that do not fully capture the cognitive processes involved in human translation. These models lack the integration of Active Inference principles, such as hierarchical inference and the minimization of free energy, which are crucial for understanding complex cognitive tasks.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
Your approach uses Active Inference to model the translation process, focusing on the states of orientation and flow that translators experience. This involves using probabilistic generative models to predict the translator's actions and linguistic outputs. The success of this approach depends on the ability of Active Inference to capture the dynamic interplay between epistemic and pragmatic behaviors.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Researchers in linguistics, cognitive science, and translation studies will be interested in this work. Success could lead to a better understanding of the cognitive processes involved in translation, which could improve translation training programs and machine translation algorithms.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of modeling the translation process, the need for large datasets of translation tasks, and the challenge of validating the model against empirical data from human translators.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require access to computational resources, software tools like MATLAB or Python libraries, and potentially some costs associated with data collection or collaborating with translation researchers.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take around 6-9 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the model and the availability of resources.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point:** After three months, evaluate the initial model's performance on a subset of translation tasks. Ensure that the model captures the basic aspects of the translation process and that the generative models are correctly implemented.
- **Final Check Point:** After nine months, validate the final model against empirical data from human translators. Present the findings in a detailed report or a research paper and consider submitting it to relevant conferences or journals.

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing an Active Inference Framework for Linguistic Communication and Dialogue

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
You aim to develop a comprehensive Active Inference framework for modeling linguistic communication and dialogue. The goal is to simulate how people engage in conversations, including the complexities of turn-taking, context maintenance, and understanding.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current models of linguistic communication often use simplified representations that do not capture the full complexity of human dialogue. These models lack the integration of Active Inference principles, such as the minimization of free energy and hierarchical inference, which are essential for understanding dynamic and context-dependent communication.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
Your approach uses Active Inference to model the entire process of linguistic communication, including predictive coding, generative models, and the integration of neural noise and linguistic complexity. This involves developing a robust framework that can simulate real-world conversations and capture the cognitive processes involved in communication. The success of this approach depends on the ability of Active Inference to model the dynamic and hierarchical nature of human communication.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Researchers in linguistics, cognitive science, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence will be interested in this work. Success could lead to a profound understanding of how humans communicate, which could have significant implications for developing more natural and effective human-computer interfaces, improving language teaching methods, and enhancing our understanding of cognitive disorders affecting communication.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the high complexity of modeling human dialogue, the need for extensive computational resources and large datasets, and the challenge of validating the model against a wide range of empirical data.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require significant computational resources, software tools, and potentially costs associated with data collection, collaborations, and attending relevant conferences.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take around 1-2 years to complete, depending on the scope and complexity of the framework.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point:** After six months, evaluate the initial framework's performance on a subset of dialogue tasks. Ensure that the model captures the basic aspects of conversation and that the generative models are correctly implemented.
- **Mid-term Check Point (12 months):** Validate the intermediate model against a broader range of empirical data on human dialogue. Present the findings in a detailed report or a research paper.
- **Final Check Point (18-24 months):** Finalize the comprehensive framework and validate it against extensive empirical data on human communication. Present the findings in a comprehensive research paper and consider submitting it to top-tier journals or conferences.
