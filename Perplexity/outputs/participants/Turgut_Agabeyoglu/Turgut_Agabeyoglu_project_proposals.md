### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Simulating Simple Dialogues Using Active Inference

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create a simple simulation of a dialogue between two synthetic subjects using Active Inference principles to understand the basic mechanisms of linguistic communication.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, simulations of dialogues often rely on simplistic models that do not fully capture the complexity of human communication. These models lack the hierarchical and predictive aspects that Active Inference provides, limiting their ability to simulate realistic conversations.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
The new approach involves using a generative model based on Active Inference to simulate dialogues. This model will incorporate hierarchical interactions among abstract states, allowing for more realistic and dynamic conversations. The use of Active Inference will enable the simulation to capture the predictive coding and belief updating processes that are crucial in human communication[5].

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of linguistic communication, which can be valuable for developing more sophisticated chatbots, improving language learning tools, and enhancing our comprehension of human dialogue.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risk is the complexity of implementing the hierarchical Active Inference model, which may require significant computational resources and expertise. Additionally, the simulation may not capture all the nuances of human dialogue, potentially leading to limited generalizability.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project is expected to be low-cost, primarily requiring access to computational resources and software tools such as Python libraries developed by the Active Inference community.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is anticipated to take approximately 1-2 weeks to complete, depending on the complexity of the simulation and the participant's familiarity with the tools and methodologies.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Weekly Checkpoint**: Complete the setup of the generative model and ensure it can simulate basic interactions.
- **Final Checkpoint**: Evaluate the simulation's ability to produce coherent and contextually relevant dialogues, and compare the outcomes with existing dialogue simulation models.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Modeling Reading and Eye Movements in Dyslexia

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a computational model using hierarchical Active Inference to simulate reading and eye movements, specifically focusing on the differences between typical readers and those with dyslexia.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current models of reading and eye movements often lack the integration of predictive coding and Active Inference, which are crucial for understanding the maladaptive inference effects seen in dyslexia. Existing models may not fully capture the hierarchical processing and the distinction between lexical and nonlexical routes in reading[4].

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
The new approach integrates large language models with hierarchical Active Inference to simulate reading and eye movements. This model will facilitate predictions and inferences at various levels of granularity, from syllables to sentences, and will allow for the simulation of maladaptive inference effects characteristic of dyslexia. The use of Active Inference will enable a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the cognitive processes underlying reading deficits[4].

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will significantly advance the understanding of dyslexia and other reading deficits, providing insights into the cognitive processes involved. This could lead to the development of more effective interventions and treatments for individuals with dyslexia.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risks include the complexity of integrating large language models with Active Inference and the potential for the model to be overly simplistic or not fully capturing the nuances of dyslexia. Additionally, there may be challenges in validating the model against empirical data.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project is expected to be moderately costly, requiring access to advanced computational resources, software tools, and possibly collaboration with experts in the field.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is anticipated to take approximately 3-6 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the model and the availability of resources.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Monthly Checkpoint**: Complete the integration of the large language model with the Active Inference framework and test the basic functionality of the model.
- **Final Checkpoint**: Evaluate the model's performance in simulating reading and eye movements for both typical readers and those with dyslexia, and compare the results with empirical data.

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Modeling Human Translation Processes Using Hierarchical Active Inference

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a hierarchically embedded architecture of an artificial agent that models human translation processes using Active Inference principles.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current models of translation processes often rely on traditional qualitative approaches or simplistic computational models that do not fully capture the complex mental processes involved in translation. These models lack the hierarchical and predictive aspects provided by Active Inference, limiting their ability to simulate realistic translation behaviors[1].

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
The new approach involves using a hierarchically embedded architecture based on Active Inference to model the translation process. This model will incorporate states of orientation and flow, predictive coding, and the interaction between cognitive and sensorimotor layers. The use of Active Inference will enable the simulation to capture the goal-oriented planning, adjustment of translation expectations, and the complex temporal and sequential relationships involved in human translation[1].

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will significantly enhance our understanding of the mental processes involved in translation, which can be valuable for developing more sophisticated translation tools, improving translation training programs, and advancing the field of translation studies.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risks include the complexity of implementing the hierarchical Active Inference model, the need for extensive empirical data to validate the model, and the potential for the model to be overly complex or not fully capturing the nuances of human translation.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project is expected to be costly, requiring significant computational resources, software tools, and possibly collaboration with experts in translation studies and cognitive science.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is anticipated to take approximately 6-12 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the model and the availability of resources.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Quarterly Checkpoint**: Complete the development of the hierarchical architecture and test the basic functionality of the model in simulating simple translation tasks.
- **Final Checkpoint**: Evaluate the model's performance in simulating complex translation processes, compare the results with empirical data from human translators, and assess the model's ability to predict translation difficulties and adjust expectations.
