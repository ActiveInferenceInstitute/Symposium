## Immediate Next Steps (1-2 weeks)

### Specific Resources to Start With
- **Book:** Begin with the introductory chapters of "Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior" by Friston et al. to solidify the foundational concepts of Active Inference[3].
- **Paper:** Read "Integrating large language models and active inference to understand eye movements in reading and dyslexia" to understand how Active Inference is applied in linguistic contexts, particularly in reading and eye movements[2].
- **Lecture:** Watch the YouTube lecture by Dr. Ina Bornkessel-Schlesewsky on "Active inference, neural noise and linguistic complexity" to gain insights into the interplay between Active Inference and linguistic complexity[4].

### Initial Learning Objectives
- Understand the basic principles of Active Inference and its application in predictive coding.
- Familiarize yourself with how Active Inference is used to model linguistic processes, especially in reading and communication.
- Recognize the role of generative models and hierarchical inference in linguistic tasks.

### Concrete Actions to Take
- Allocate 2 hours each day for 1 week to read the introductory chapters of the book and the selected paper.
- Take notes on key concepts and methodologies described.
- Summarize the main points of the lecture and relate them to your current understanding of Active Inference.

## Short-Term Goals (1-3 months)

### Key Concepts to Master
- **Generative Models:** Deepen your understanding of generative models and their role in Active Inference, particularly in linguistic communication[3][4].
- **Hierarchical Inference:** Learn how hierarchical inference is applied in reading and eye movements, and how it integrates with large language models[2].
- **Free Energy Principle:** Understand the free energy principle and its minimization in the context of Active Inference.

### Practical Exercises or Projects
- **Simulation Project:** Use the concepts from the papers to simulate a simple linguistic communication scenario using Active Inference. This could involve modeling a dialogue or a reading task.
- **Case Study:** Analyze a case study on dyslexia using the model described in "Integrating large language models and active inference to understand eye movements in reading and dyslexia"[2].
