## Immediate Next Steps (1-2 weeks)

### Specific Resources to Start With
- **Lecture by Dr. Ina Bornkessel-Schlesewsky**: Watch the lecture on "Active inference, neural noise and linguistic complexity" to gain insights into the relationship between linguistic complexity and cognitive outcomes[1].
- **Research Paper on Reading and Eye Movements**: Read the paper "Integrating large language models and active inference to understand eye movements in reading and dyslexia" to understand the computational model simulating reading processes[5].

### Initial Learning Objectives
- Understand the basic principles of Active Inference in the context of linguistic complexity and cognitive aging.
- Gain an overview of how Active Inference models simulate reading and eye movements, particularly in relation to dyslexia.

### Concrete Actions to Take
- **Watch and Summarize the Lecture**: Watch Dr. Bornkessel-Schlesewsky's lecture and summarize the key points, focusing on how Active Inference explains the relationship between linguistic complexity and cognitive outcomes.
- **Read and Analyze the Research Paper**: Read the paper on integrating large language models with Active Inference and analyze how the model simulates reading processes and eye movements.
- **Create a Concept Map**: Create a concept map linking the key concepts from both the lecture and the paper to visualize the relationships between Active Inference, linguistic complexity, and reading processes.

## Short-Term Goals (1-3 months)

### Key Concepts to Master
- **Generative Models and Linguistic Communication**: Understand how generative models and Active Inference formulate linguistic communication, including simulations of dialogues and underlying neurophysiological correlates[3].
