  "content": "### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Active Inference Simulation Toolkit for Educational Purposes\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nCreate an interactive simulation toolkit to help students and researchers understand the basics of Active Inference through hands-on experiments and visualizations.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrently, Active Inference is often taught through theoretical lectures and papers, which can be abstract and difficult to grasp for newcomers. Existing simulation tools are either too complex or not user-friendly, limiting their educational potential.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project will develop a user-friendly simulation toolkit using Python libraries like PyMC3 or Stan, and visualization tools such as Matplotlib or Plotly. The toolkit will include pre-built scenarios and interactive modules that allow users to adjust parameters and observe the effects on Active Inference models. This approach leverages Jakub Lanc's teaching experience and his background in psychology and computer science to create an engaging and educational resource.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nThis toolkit will benefit students, researchers, and educators in the fields of psychology, computer science, and neuroscience by providing a practical and interactive way to learn Active Inference. It will enhance the learning experience, making the subject more accessible and engaging.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\n- Technical challenges in integrating different libraries and tools.\n- Ensuring the toolkit is robust and user-friendly.\n- Limited adoption if not properly disseminated to the academic community.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\n- Minimal costs, primarily time and effort. Potential use of open-source libraries and existing resources.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\n- Approximately 2-3 months to develop the initial version of the toolkit.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Mid-term Check Point:** Complete the design and initial implementation of the toolkit within the first month. Test it with a small group of students or peers.\n- **Final Check Point:** Release the toolkit and gather feedback from a broader audience within the next two months. Iterate based on feedback to improve the toolkit.\n\n### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with Digital Identity Research\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nIntegrate Active Inference models into research on digital identity to better understand and predict online behavior and decision-making processes.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrent research on digital identity often relies on traditional psychological and sociological models that do not fully account for the dynamic and adaptive nature of online interactions. Active Inference can provide a more comprehensive framework but is not yet widely applied in this field.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project will use hierarchical hybrid active inference models to analyze and predict online behavior. It will involve collecting data on online interactions, applying Active Inference to model these interactions, and comparing the results with traditional models. The integration of psychological insights with computational models will leverage Lanc's interdisciplinary background and provide a more nuanced understanding of digital identity.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nThis project will benefit researchers in psychology, computer science, and sociology by providing a novel framework for understanding digital identity. It will also have practical implications for online platforms and policymakers interested in managing and predicting online behavior.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\n- Data collection and privacy issues.\n- Complexity in integrating Active Inference with existing research methodologies.\n- Potential resistance to adopting new theoretical frameworks.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\n- Moderate costs, including potential funding for data collection and software tools. Collaboration with other researchers may help share resources.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\n- Approximately 6-9 months to complete the data collection, model development, and initial analysis.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Mid-term Check Point:** Complete data collection and initial model development within the first 3-4 months. Conduct preliminary analysis and present findings to a research group.\n- **Final Check Point:** Complete the full analysis, write and submit a research paper, and present the findings at a conference within the next 3-5 months.\n\n### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing a Hybrid Active Inference Framework for Collective Intelligence\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nDevelop a hybrid Active Inference framework that can model and predict collective intelligence in complex, dynamic environments, such as online communities or social networks.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrent models of collective intelligence often lack a comprehensive theoretical framework that integrates both individual and collective behavior. Active Inference can provide such a framework but requires significant development to scale to complex, dynamic environments.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project will integrate hierarchical hybrid active inference models with deep learning techniques to model collective behavior. It will involve developing new algorithms for scaling Active Inference to large groups, testing these models in simulated and real-world scenarios, and validating the results against existing data. The approach will leverage Lanc's expertise in psychology and computer science, as well as potential collaborations with researchers from the 4th International Workshop on Active Inference[2].\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nThis project will significantly impact research in collective intelligence, social networks, and decision-making. It will provide a powerful tool for understanding and predicting group behavior, benefiting fields such as sociology, psychology, and computer science. Practical applications could include managing online communities, predicting social trends, and optimizing group decision-making processes.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\n- High complexity in developing and scaling the models.\n- Significant data requirements and potential privacy issues.\n- Potential resistance to adopting new theoretical and methodological approaches.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\n- Substantial costs, including funding for data collection, software development, and potential collaborations. Grant proposals and institutional support may be necessary.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\n- Approximately 12-18 months to complete the initial development and testing of the framework.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Mid-term Check Point:** Complete the initial development of the hybrid framework and conduct preliminary testing within the first 6 months. Present the progress to a research group or at a conference.\n- **Final Check Point:** Complete the full testing and validation of the framework, write and submit a research paper, and present the findings at a major conference within the next 6-12 months. Iterate based on feedback to refine the framework further.",
