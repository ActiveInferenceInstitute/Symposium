**Actions:**

1. **Introduction to Active Inference:**
   - Start with the paper "Active inference and learning" to understand the basics of Active Inference, its distinction between goal-directed and habitual behavior, and how it relates to Bayesian inference and free energy[5].
   - Watch introductory lectures or videos by Karl Friston or other prominent researchers in the field to get a broad overview.

2. **Explore Key Resources:**
   - Visit the special issue of *Entropy* dedicated to Professor Karl Friston, which includes various articles on Active Inference, Bayesian mechanics, and related topics. This will provide a comprehensive introduction to the field and its current research directions[1].
   - Browse the arXiv papers on Active Inference, such as "Learning in Hybrid Active Inference Models" to understand the latest developments and applications[4].

3. **Join Online Communities:**
   - Register and participate in forums or discussion groups related to Active Inference, such as those on Reddit or specialized research communities.

**Resources:**
- Paper: "Active inference and learning"[5]
- Special Issue: *Entropy* - From Functional Imaging to Free Energy[1]
