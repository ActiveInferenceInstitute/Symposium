   - Start with the foundational paper on Active Inference, such as "Active Inference: A Process Theory" by Karl Friston.
   - Watch introductory videos or lectures on Active Inference, for example, those available on the Active Inference Institute's website or YouTube channels.

2. **Explore Key Concepts:**
   - Read the introduction and key sections of the paper "A generic, compositional and interpretable class of generative world models" to understand the integration of Bayesian structure learning and intrinsically motivated planning[1].
   - Familiarize yourself with terms like "generative world models," "Bayesian inference," and "intrinsically motivated planning."

3. **Join Online Communities:**
   - Register for relevant forums or discussion groups, such as the Active Inference subreddit or specialized groups on LinkedIn.
   - Follow researchers and institutions active in the field of Active Inference on social media and academic networks.

4. **Initial Learning Resources:**
   - Visit the [Active Inference Institute](https://www.activeinference.org/) website for introductory materials and resources.
   - Explore the [NeurIPS Workshop on Intrinsically Motivated Open-ended Learning (IMOL)] resources, which might provide insights into the latest developments and applications[1].

#### Short-Term Goals (1-3 months)

**Objective:**
- Master the core concepts and principles of Active Inference.
- Apply these principles through practical exercises and projects.

**Actions:**
