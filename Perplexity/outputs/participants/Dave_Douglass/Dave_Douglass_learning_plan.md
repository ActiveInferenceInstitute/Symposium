### Immediate Next Steps (1-2 weeks)

#### Specific Resources to Start With:
- **Active Inference Institute's Livestreams and Discussions**:
  - Start with the upcoming "Applied Active Inference Symposium" on November 13-14, 2024, to stay updated on the latest developments and network with other researchers[1].
  - Watch past livestreams such as "Insights #023" with Iain McGilchrist on "Hemispheric Lateralisation, Relationality, Being-In-The-World" to deepen understanding of the theoretical foundations[1].

#### Initial Learning Objectives:
- Gain a refreshed understanding of the core principles of Active Inference, particularly its application in various fields.
- Identify potential collaboration opportunities within the Active Inference community.

#### Concrete Actions to Take:
- Register for the "Applied Active Inference Symposium" and prepare questions or topics for discussion.
- Review the recent newsletter from the Active Inference Institute to stay informed about ongoing projects and initiatives[4].
- Engage with the community by participating in the discussion forums or commenting on recent livestreams.

### Short-Term Goals (1-3 months)

#### Key Concepts to Master:
- **Advanced Mathematical and Computational Tools**:
  - Delve deeper into mathematical modeling and computational neuroscience. Join the informal Math Group sessions offered by the Active Inference Institute[4].
  - Study the basics of variational free energy and its application in Active Inference, using resources like the article "A tale of two densities: active inference is enactive inference"[2].

#### Practical Exercises or Projects:
- **Ontology Integration Project**:
  - Continue working on integrating Active Inference ontology with other systems, using the resources from the "Aligning Active Inference Ontology to SUMO" and "Aligning Spatial Web Terms to SUMO" projects[1].
  - Collaborate with Andrew Pashea on the “Active Agents: An Active Inference Approach to Agent-Based Modeling in the Social Sciences” project to apply ontological frameworks in modeling complex systems[1].

#### Recommended Study Materials:
- **Textbook and Tutorial Resources**:
  - Participate in the Textbook Group project, which includes Cohort 7 and Cohort 6, starting on July 15th. This will involve using RxInfer.jl for better understanding and applicability of textbook materials[4].
  - Use the syllabus provided by Jared Tumiel for spinning up in Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle, which includes background in neuroscience, control theory, physics, and computer science[5].

#### Community Engagement Opportunities:
- **Roundtable Discussions and Livestreams**:
  - Attend the MathArtStream sessions, such as "Mathematical Holiday Poetry" on December 13, 2024, to engage with interdisciplinary discussions[1].
  - Participate in the Active Inference Insights series, such as the upcoming episodes, to stay updated with the latest research and insights[1].

### Medium-Term Development (3-6 months)

#### Advanced Topics to Explore:
- **Deep Dive into Free Energy Principle**:
  - Watch the video "The Free Energy Principle and Active Inference: From Physics to Mind" featuring Dr. Karl Friston to understand the foundational concepts of the Free Energy Principle and its implications[3].
  - Study advanced topics such as Markov blankets, internal and external states, and circular causality as discussed in the video and related academic papers[3].

#### Potential Collaboration Opportunities:
- **Interdisciplinary Projects**:
  - Collaborate with Sanjeev Namjoshi on his upcoming textbook to ensure the educational materials are comprehensive and aligned with the latest research[4].
  - Engage with the Unifysica project, particularly with Ana Magdalena Hurtado, to explore social sciences ontologies for health and disease[4].

#### Application Projects in Their Domain:
- **Systems Memetics and General Semantics**:
  - Apply Active Inference principles to Systems Memetics and General Semantics by integrating ontological frameworks and conducting case studies.
  - Develop a project proposal to integrate Active Inference with existing frameworks in these fields, leveraging his background in machine translation and nonprofit work.

#### Skill-Building Activities:
- **Software Tools and Frameworks**:
  - Learn to use RxInfer.jl and other software tools relevant to Active Inference, through the Math Group sessions and other educational programs offered by the Active Inference Institute[4].
  - Participate in coding projects, such as those in the Symbolic cognitive robotics project, to gain practical experience in applying Active Inference in computational contexts[4].

### Specific Resources

#### Active Inference Institute Materials:
- **Livestreams and Discussions**: Utilize the various livestream series like GuestStream, MathStream, and Insights[1].
- **Textbook Group**: Join the Textbook Group project for comprehensive learning and application of Active Inference principles[4].

#### Academic Papers and Tutorials:
- **"A tale of two densities: active inference is enactive inference"**: Study this article to understand the core constructs of Active Inference and its distinction from other Bayesian theories[2].
- **Syllabus by Jared Tumiel**: Use this syllabus as a guide to understand the necessary background and map of the territory for Active Inference[5].

#### Software Tools and Frameworks:
- **RxInfer.jl**: Learn and apply this software tool through the Math Group sessions and other educational programs[4].
- **GitHub Repositories**: Engage with open-source projects like the Symbolic cognitive robotics project to gain practical experience[4].

#### Community Resources and Events:
- **Active Inference Institute's Community Forum**: Engage actively in the community forums to discuss ideas, ask questions, and collaborate with other researchers[1].
- **Upcoming Symposia and Workshops**: Attend events like the "Applied Active Inference Symposium" to network and stay updated[1].

### Progress Tracking

#### Milestones and Checkpoints:
- **Monthly Review**: Set a monthly review to assess progress on current projects and learning objectives.
- **Project Completion**: Track the completion of specific projects, such as the ontology integration or the application of Active Inference in Systems Memetics.

#### Self-Assessment Methods:
- **Reflective Journaling**: Maintain a reflective journal to document learning progress, challenges faced, and insights gained.
- **Peer Feedback**: Seek feedback from peers and collaborators on the projects and learning outcomes.

#### Practical Application Opportunities:
- **Case Studies**: Conduct case studies in applying Active Inference to real-world problems in Systems Memetics and General Semantics.
- **Community Presentations**: Present the findings and applications of Active Inference at community events or roundtable discussions to receive feedback and validation.

By following this structured learning plan, Dave Douglass can leverage his diverse background and current contributions to deepen his understanding of Active Inference, enhance his skills, and contribute meaningfully to the community.
