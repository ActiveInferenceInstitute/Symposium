### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference Ontology in Educational Materials

**1. What are you trying to do?**
Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon:
- Enhance the educational materials for Active Inference by integrating the recently developed ontological works into the Textbook Group project.

**2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**
- Currently, the Textbook Group project focuses on preparing and refining educational materials for Active Inference, but these materials may lack a comprehensive ontological framework. The limits include the absence of a unified ontological structure that can facilitate better understanding and application of Active Inference principles.

**3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?**
- The new approach involves integrating the ontological works “Aligning Active Inference Ontology to SUMO” and “Aligning Spatial Web Terms to SUMO” into the educational materials. This integration will provide a structured and unified framework, making it easier for learners to understand and apply Active Inference. The success is anticipated because it leverages Dave Douglass's expertise in ontology and his involvement in the Textbook Group project.

**4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?**
- The success of this project will benefit the entire Active Inference community, particularly students and educators involved in the Textbook Group. It will enhance the clarity and coherence of the educational materials, facilitating a deeper understanding of Active Inference.

**5. What are the risks?**
- The primary risk is the complexity of integrating ontological frameworks into educational materials without making them overly technical or inaccessible to a broad audience.

**6. How much will it cost?**
- This project is expected to be low-cost, as it primarily involves the time and effort of Dave Douglass and other participants in the Textbook Group. No additional funding is anticipated.

**7. How long will it take?**
- The project is expected to take approximately 1-2 months, aligning with the upcoming cohort sessions of the Textbook Group.

**8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?**
- **Mid-term Check Point:** Review the integrated materials with a small group of learners to gather feedback on clarity and effectiveness.
- **Final Check Point:** Assess the overall impact on the learning outcomes of the Textbook Group participants after the completion of the cohort.

**Collaborators/Resources:**
- Collaborate with Sanjeev Namjoshi and other participants in the Textbook Group.
- Utilize the resources from the Active Inference Institute, including the ontological works and the Textbook Group project materials.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Applying Active Inference to Systems Memetics

**1. What are you trying to do?**
Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon:
- Develop and apply Active Inference principles to the field of Systems Memetics, creating a framework that integrates ontological structures and case studies.

**2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**
- Currently, Systems Memetics lacks a formal theoretical framework that incorporates the predictive and inferential aspects of Active Inference. The limits include the lack of a structured approach to understanding and modeling memetic systems.

**3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?**
- The new approach involves applying the Active Inference Framework (AIF) to Systems Memetics, leveraging Bayesian inference and predictive coding to model how memes propagate and evolve. This integration will provide a more robust and predictive framework for understanding memetic systems. Success is anticipated due to Dave Douglass's background in machine translation and his experience with ontological works.

**4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?**
- The success of this project will benefit researchers and practitioners in the fields of Systems Memetics and General Semantics. It will provide a new theoretical tool for analyzing and predicting the behavior of memetic systems, enhancing our understanding of cultural and social dynamics.

**5. What are the risks?**
- The primary risks include the complexity of integrating Active Inference with a new field and the potential resistance to new theoretical approaches within the existing community.

**6. How much will it cost?**
- This project may require some funding for resources such as access to computational tools and potential collaboration with other researchers. However, the costs are expected to be moderate.

**7. How long will it take?**
- The project is expected to take approximately 3-6 months, allowing for the development of the framework, case studies, and initial validation.

**8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?**
- **Mid-term Check Point:** Present the initial framework and case studies to a peer group for feedback and validation.
- **Final Check Point:** Publish a paper or present at a conference to disseminate the findings and gather broader feedback from the academic community.

**Collaborators/Resources:**
- Collaborate with researchers in Systems Memetics and General Semantics.
- Utilize resources from the Active Inference Institute, including the Math Group sessions and the Symbolic cognitive robotics project for computational tools and methodologies.

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing an Integrated Neuro-Bio-Social Model for Collective Behavior

**1. What are you trying to do?**
Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon:
- Develop an integrated neuro-bio-social model that applies Active Inference to understand collective behavior and social dynamics, incorporating insights from sociology, neuroscience, and cognitive science.

**2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**
- Currently, models of collective behavior often lack a unified framework that integrates neurological, biological, and social aspects. The limits include the fragmented nature of current models, which do not fully capture the interdependencies between these domains.

**3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?**
- The new approach involves using the Active Inference Framework (AIF) to develop a model that integrates predictive coding, Bayesian inference, and social dynamics. This model will provide a principled normative account of how brains interact within social contexts, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of collective behavior. Success is anticipated due to the interdisciplinary nature of the project, leveraging Dave Douglass's background in psychology, machine translation, and his experience with ontological works.

**4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?**
- The success of this project will have significant implications for fields such as sociology, neuroscience, and cognitive science. It will provide a new paradigm for understanding collective behavior, which can be applied in various areas like social policy, education, and public health.

**5. What are the risks?**
- The primary risks include the complexity of integrating multiple disciplines, the need for significant interdisciplinary collaboration, and the potential resistance to new theoretical approaches.

**6. How much will it cost?**
- This project is expected to require substantial funding to support the interdisciplinary research team, computational resources, and potential field studies.

**7. How long will it take?**
- The project is expected to take approximately 1-2 years, allowing for the development of the model, data collection, validation, and dissemination of findings.

**8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?**
- **Mid-term Check Point:** Present the initial model and preliminary findings at a major conference to gather feedback from the broader academic community.
- **Final Check Point:** Publish a comprehensive paper or book detailing the model, its applications, and the empirical evidence supporting it.

**Collaborators/Resources:**
- Collaborate with researchers from sociology, neuroscience, and cognitive science.
- Utilize resources from the Active Inference Institute, including the Math Group sessions, the Symbolic cognitive robotics project, and other interdisciplinary initiatives.
- Engage with projects like the “Active Agents: An Active Inference Approach to Agent-Based Modeling in the Social Sciences” for methodological support and validation[1][2].
