### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Developing AI-Assisted Negotiation Tools Using Active Inference

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create a basic AI-assisted negotiation tool that compares the efficacy of Active Inference with Reinforcement Learning in real-world negotiation scenarios.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, negotiation tools often rely on Reinforcement Learning, which can be limited by the need for extensive training data and the lack of a built-in mechanism for belief updating and precision weighting. Active Inference offers a promising alternative by incorporating Bayesian inference and free energy minimization, but it has not been widely applied in negotiation tools.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will integrate Active Inference into negotiation tools, leveraging its ability to update beliefs based on sensory precision and prior knowledge. This approach is new because it applies the theoretical foundations of Active Inference to a practical negotiation context, potentially enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of negotiation processes.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will benefit researchers and practitioners in the fields of AI, negotiation, and conflict resolution. Successful implementation could lead to more effective and adaptive negotiation tools, improving outcomes in various negotiation scenarios, from business to humanitarian contexts.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- Technical risks: Integrating Active Inference with existing negotiation frameworks could be challenging.
- Practical risks: The tool may not perform better than existing Reinforcement Learning-based tools in all scenarios.
- Collaboration risks: Coordinating with other researchers and stakeholders might be time-consuming.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will primarily require time and computational resources, which are likely available through the Active Inference Institute. No significant additional funding is expected.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- Initial development: 1-2 months
- Testing and refinement: 1-2 months
- Total duration: 2-4 months

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: Complete the initial integration of Active Inference into the negotiation tool and conduct preliminary tests (1 month).
- **Final Check Point**: Conduct comprehensive testing, gather feedback, and refine the tool based on results (2 months).

**Potential Collaborators/Resources:**
- Susan Hasty for her work on AI-assisted negotiation tools.
- Active Inference Institute resources, including the Textbook Group materials and RxInfer.jl.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with Ontological Systems for Enhanced Knowledge Representation

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and apply an integrated framework that aligns Active Inference with ontological systems like SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology) to enhance knowledge representation and reasoning in complex domains.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, Active Inference is applied in various domains but often lacks a unified ontological framework. Ontological systems like SUMO provide a structured way of representing knowledge, but they do not inherently incorporate the dynamic belief updating of Active Inference. The current practice is limited by the lack of integration between these two approaches.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will integrate the belief updating and precision weighting mechanisms of Active Inference with the structured knowledge representation of ontological systems. This integration is new and promising because it combines the strengths of both approaches, enabling more robust and adaptive knowledge representation and reasoning.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will benefit researchers and practitioners in AI, cognitive science, and knowledge representation. Successful integration could lead to more robust and adaptive knowledge systems, enhancing decision-making and reasoning in various complex domains.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- Technical risks: Integrating Active Inference with ontological systems could be complex.
- Practical risks: The integrated framework may not perform better than existing systems in all scenarios.
- Collaboration risks: Coordinating with ontologists and AI researchers might be challenging.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project may require some additional funding for software tools and potential collaborations, but it is largely dependent on existing resources and expertise within the Active Inference Institute.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- Initial integration and testing: 3-4 months
- Refinement and validation: 3-4 months
- Total duration: 6-8 months

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: Complete the initial integration of Active Inference with the ontological system and conduct preliminary tests (3 months).
- **Final Check Point**: Conduct comprehensive testing, gather feedback, and refine the framework based on results (6 months).

**Potential Collaborators/Resources:**
- Dave Douglass’s previous work on “Aligning Active Inference Ontology to SUMO.”
- Active Inference Institute resources, including the Ontology project.
- Collaboration with ontologists and AI researchers.

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Applying Active Inference to Collective Foraging and Social Negotiation in Real-World Scenarios

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and apply Active Inference models to real-world collective foraging and social negotiation scenarios, such as humanitarian crisis management, to improve decision-making and collective behavior.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, collective foraging and social negotiation in complex scenarios often rely on simplistic models that do not fully account for the dynamic and adaptive nature of human behavior. Active Inference offers a more comprehensive approach by incorporating Bayesian inference and free energy minimization, but it has not been widely applied in these contexts.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will apply Active Inference to model and predict collective behavior in real-world scenarios, leveraging its ability to update beliefs and precision weights dynamically. This approach is new because it integrates theoretical Active Inference models with practical applications in collective foraging and social negotiation, potentially enhancing decision-making and collective outcomes.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will benefit researchers, policymakers, and practitioners in fields such as humanitarian aid, social sciences, and AI. Successful implementation could lead to more effective management of collective behavior in crisis scenarios, improving outcomes and saving lives.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- Technical risks: Applying Active Inference to complex real-world scenarios could be challenging.
- Practical risks: The models may not perform better than existing approaches in all scenarios.
- Collaboration risks: Coordinating with stakeholders from various fields might be time-consuming and challenging.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will likely require significant funding for data collection, software development, and collaborations with various stakeholders.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- Initial model development and testing: 6-9 months
- Field testing and validation: 9-12 months
- Total duration: 15-21 months

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: Complete the initial model development and conduct preliminary field tests (6 months).
- **Final Check Point**: Conduct comprehensive field testing, gather feedback, and refine the models based on results (15 months).

**Potential Collaborators/Resources:**
- Susan Hasty for her work on negotiation affordances.
- Active Inference Institute resources, including the Action Research on Collective Foraging project.
- Collaboration with humanitarian organizations, policymakers, and researchers from social sciences and AI.
- Funding opportunities through ARPA-H or similar programs focused on advanced analysis and collective behavior[3].
