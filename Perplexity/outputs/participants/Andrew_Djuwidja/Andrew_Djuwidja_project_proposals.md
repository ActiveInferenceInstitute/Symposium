### Project Proposal 1: Implementing a Simple Discrete-State Active Inference Model

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create a simple discrete-state active inference model to understand and simulate basic agent behavior using Active Inference principles.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, discrete-state active inference models are implemented using various programming languages like MATLAB or Python. However, for newcomers, the lack of clear, step-by-step guides and accessible resources can be a significant barrier. Existing implementations often assume a higher level of technical familiarity, which can limit their usability for beginners.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will follow a structured approach using resources like "A Step-by-Step Tutorial on Active Inference and its Application to Empirical Data" by Ryan Smith, Karl Friston, and Christopher Whyte[2]. The new aspect is the focus on creating a highly accessible, newcomer-friendly implementation guide, leveraging Python and using libraries such as `scipy` and `numpy`. This will include detailed comments, explanations, and a simple grid-world scenario to demonstrate the model's functionality.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will provide Andrew Djuwidja with a solid foundation in Active Inference, allowing him to better understand and apply the theory. It will also contribute to the community by offering a clear, step-by-step guide that can help other newcomers implement discrete-state active inference models.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risk is the complexity of the mathematical concepts, which might be challenging to simplify without losing accuracy. Additionally, there is a risk of not finding the right balance between detail and accessibility.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project is expected to be low-cost, as it will primarily utilize free or open-source resources and software tools.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project should take approximately 2-3 months to complete, including the initial learning phase, implementation, and testing.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: Complete the initial implementation of the discrete-state active inference model within the first month.
- **Final Check Point**: Successfully simulate agent behavior in a grid-world scenario and document the process with a detailed guide by the end of the third month.

### Project Proposal 2: Enhancing the Cat Agent with Predictive Planning and Counterfactual Learning

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Enhance the existing cat agent project by integrating predictive planning and counterfactual learning using Active Inference principles.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, predictive planning and counterfactual learning in Active Inference are advanced topics that require a deep understanding of the theory and its mathematical underpinnings. The existing cat agent project likely lacks these sophisticated decision-making schemes, limiting its ability to handle complex scenarios.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will build on the foundational understanding gained from the initial discrete-state active inference model. It will incorporate predictive planning and counterfactual learning by leveraging recent research papers and tutorials, such as "On Predictive planning and counterfactual learning in active inference"[4]. The new approach will involve:
- Implementing predictive planning to enable the cat agent to anticipate future states and make informed decisions.
- Integrating counterfactual learning to allow the agent to learn from hypothetical scenarios.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success will significantly enhance the cat agent's decision-making capabilities, making it more sophisticated and adaptable. This will also contribute to the broader understanding of how Active Inference can be applied to real-world problems, such as in robotics or autonomous systems.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of implementing predictive planning and counterfactual learning, which require advanced mathematical and programming skills. There is also a risk of overcomplicating the model, leading to performance issues.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project is expected to be low-cost, as it will primarily utilize existing resources and software tools.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project should take approximately 4-6 months to complete, including the initial research phase, implementation, and testing.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: Complete the implementation of predictive planning within the first 2 months.
- **Final Check Point**: Successfully integrate counterfactual learning and demonstrate the enhanced decision-making capabilities of the cat agent by the end of the sixth month.

### Project Proposal 3: Developing an Active Inference Framework for Multi-Agent Systems

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a comprehensive Active Inference framework for simulating and analyzing multi-agent systems, focusing on their interactions and collective behavior.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current approaches to multi-agent systems often use traditional reinforcement learning or game theory methods, which may not fully capture the complex interactions and adaptive behaviors seen in real-world scenarios. Active Inference offers a promising alternative but is rarely applied to multi-agent systems due to its complexity.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will leverage the advanced concepts of Active Inference, including predictive planning, counterfactual learning, and transfer learning. The new approach will involve:
- Developing a unified framework that integrates Active Inference with multi-agent simulation tools.
- Implementing agents that use Active Inference to predict and adapt to the actions of other agents.
- Using transfer learning to enable agents to learn from interactions with different agents and environments.

The success of this approach hinges on the ability to scale Active Inference to complex multi-agent scenarios, which has been a significant challenge in the field. Recent advancements in deep learning and Bayesian methods provide a promising pathway for achieving this.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will provide a groundbreaking framework for understanding and simulating complex multi-agent interactions, which is crucial in fields such as robotics, autonomous systems, and social sciences. It will also contribute significantly to the theoretical and practical applications of Active Inference.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risks include the high complexity of the project, the need for significant computational resources, and the challenge of scaling Active Inference to multi-agent scenarios. There is also a risk of encountering unforeseen challenges in integrating different components of the framework.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project may require moderate to high costs due to the potential need for advanced computational resources and possibly collaboration with other researchers or institutions.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take approximately 12-18 months to complete, including the initial research phase, framework development, implementation, and extensive testing.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: Complete the development of the unified framework and initial implementation of Active Inference in a multi-agent scenario within the first 6 months.
- **Final Check Point**: Successfully simulate and analyze complex multi-agent interactions using the developed framework and demonstrate its efficacy by the end of the 18th month.

Each of these proposals aligns with Andrew Djuwidja's background and interests, provides a clear path for learning and application, and addresses both immediate and long-term goals in the context of Active Inference.
