### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Implementing a Simple Active Inference Agent

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create a basic Active Inference agent that can navigate a simple environment, such as a grid world, using generative models to infer its state and select actions.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, implementing Active Inference agents often involves complex mathematical and computational steps, which can be daunting for newcomers. The limits include the need for a strong background in Bayesian inference, control theory, and programming skills, which can hinder quick experimentation and learning.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project simplifies the process by using existing libraries (e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow) to create a basic generative model. The approach will be successful because it leverages pre-built tools and provides a step-by-step guide, making it easier for Andrew to implement and understand the core concepts of Active Inference.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will help Andrew gain hands-on experience with Active Inference, allowing him to apply the theory in a practical context. This will enhance his understanding and confidence in using Active Inference, making him more proficient in his current "cat agent" project.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risk is the potential complexity of debugging the model, especially if Andrew is new to programming or Bayesian inference. However, this can be mitigated by following detailed tutorials and seeking help from online forums.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will not incur any additional costs beyond the use of freely available software libraries and online resources.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project should take approximately 1-2 weeks to complete, depending on the depth of implementation and the amount of time Andrew can dedicate each week.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point (after 3-4 days):** Successfully set up the environment and implement a basic generative model.
- **Final Check Point (after 1-2 weeks):** The agent should be able to navigate the grid world using Active Inference principles, and Andrew should be able to explain the key concepts and steps involved.

**Technical Details and Methodologies:**
- Use PyTorch or TensorFlow to create a simple generative model.
- Implement a grid world environment where the agent can move.
- Follow tutorials from resources like Jared Tumiel's blog post on "Spinning Up in Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle"[3].

**Potential Collaborators or Resources:**
- Active Inference Institute's YouTube channel and blog posts.
- Online forums and discussion groups related to Active Inference.
- Tutorials and code examples from the Neuromatch Academy.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Hybrid Active Inference Models for Agent Behavior

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and implement a hybrid Active Inference model that combines discrete and continuous variables to enhance the behavior of the "cat agent" in more complex scenarios.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, Active Inference models are often limited to either discrete or continuous state-spaces, which can restrict their applicability in real-world scenarios. The limits include the complexity of integrating different types of models and the computational demands of such hybrid approaches.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project integrates both discrete and continuous variables, allowing for more realistic and adaptive agent behavior. The approach will be successful because it leverages recent advancements in hybrid Active Inference models, and Andrew will have the opportunity to learn and apply these advanced concepts in a practical setting.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will significantly enhance the capabilities of the "cat agent," making it more adaptable and realistic. This will contribute to the broader field of Active Inference by demonstrating the feasibility and benefits of hybrid models in agent-based systems.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of integrating different types of models and the potential for increased computational demands. However, these can be mitigated by using efficient algorithms and leveraging pre-existing implementations.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will not incur significant additional costs, as it will primarily use existing software libraries and online resources.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project should take approximately 3-6 months to complete, depending on the depth of implementation and the amount of time Andrew can dedicate each week.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point (after 2 months):** Successfully integrate discrete and continuous variables into a single model framework.
- **Final Check Point (after 3-6 months):** The "cat agent" should demonstrate improved adaptability and performance in complex scenarios, and Andrew should be able to explain the benefits and challenges of using hybrid Active Inference models.

**Technical Details and Methodologies:**
- Use libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow to implement hybrid models.
- Follow the approach outlined in papers like "Learning in Hybrid Active Inference Models"[3].
- Utilize the Neuromatch Academy's materials for setting up experiments and designing simulations.

**Potential Collaborators or Resources:**

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Active Inference in Multi-Agent Systems for Complex Scenarios

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and implement an Active Inference framework for multi-agent systems, allowing agents to interact and learn from each other in complex, dynamic environments.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, Active Inference is mostly applied to single-agent scenarios. The limits include the lack of methodologies for scaling Active Inference to multi-agent systems and the complexity of managing interactions between agents.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will develop a novel framework for applying Active Inference in multi-agent systems, enabling agents to infer the actions and intentions of other agents. The approach will be successful because it leverages recent advancements in deep learning and Active Inference, and Andrew will have the opportunity to contribute to a cutting-edge area of research.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will have significant implications for fields such as robotics, autonomous systems, and social sciences, where multi-agent interactions are crucial. It will advance the understanding of how Active Inference can be applied in complex, real-world scenarios.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of managing multi-agent interactions, the potential for increased computational demands, and the challenge of scaling Active Inference to larger systems. However, these can be mitigated by using efficient algorithms, leveraging pre-existing implementations, and collaborating with experts in the field.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project may incur costs related to accessing advanced computational resources or attending specialized workshops. However, these costs can be minimized by leveraging free or low-cost resources and collaborating with other researchers.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project should take approximately 6-12 months to complete, depending on the depth of implementation and the amount of time Andrew can dedicate each week.
