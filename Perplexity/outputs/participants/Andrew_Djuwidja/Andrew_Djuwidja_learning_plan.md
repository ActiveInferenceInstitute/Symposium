### Personalized Learning Plan for Andrew Djuwidja on Active Inference

#### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Jared Tumiel's Syllabus**: Begin with the introductory materials and short, intuitive primers on the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference. This syllabus provides a structured approach to understanding the basics and gradually delving into more technical details[3].
- **"A Step-by-Step Tutorial on Active Inference and its Application to Empirical Data"**: This tutorial by Ryan Smith, Karl Friston, and Christopher Whyte is highly recommended for a comprehensive walkthrough of the mathematical basis and application of Active Inference[1].

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Gain a basic understanding of the Free Energy Principle and its relationship with Active Inference.
- Understand the core concepts of variational inference and how it applies to perception and action.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Spend 2-3 hours each week reading through the introductory sections of Jared Tumiel's syllabus.
- Complete the "A Step-by-Step Tutorial" to get hands-on experience with the mathematical and empirical aspects of Active Inference.
- Watch introductory videos or lectures by John Vervaeke or other experts featured in the Active Inference Institute's resources to supplement your understanding.

#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Discrete, Continuous, and Deep Active Inference**: Understand the different strands of work within Active Inference, including discrete-state-space, continuous-time, and deep learning approaches[1].
- **Variational Inference and Free Energy**: Deepen your understanding of variational inference, the free energy principle, and how these are applied in Active Inference models.
- **Action and Perception**: Learn how Active Inference integrates action and perception through unified objective functions and variational inference.

**Practical Exercises or Projects:**
- **Implement a Simple Discrete-State Active Inference Model**: Use MATLAB or Python to implement a basic discrete-state active inference model. Resources like the detailed walkthrough in "A Step-by-Step Tutorial" can guide this implementation[1].
- **Simulate Agent Behavior**: Use the concepts learned to simulate simple agent behavior in a controlled environment, such as a grid-world scenario, to understand how Active Inference guides decision-making[4].

**Recommended Study Materials:**
- **"Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms" by David MacKay**: This textbook provides detailed information on information theory and inference, which are crucial for understanding the technical aspects of Active Inference[3].
- **"Active inference and learning" by Karl Friston et al.**: This paper offers insights into choice behavior, learning, and the distinction between goal-directed and habitual behavior, which can help in understanding the practical applications of Active Inference[2].

**Community Engagement Opportunities:**
- **Join Online Forums and Groups**: Participate in online forums, such as the Active Inference subreddit or specialized groups on LinkedIn, to engage with other researchers and practitioners.
- **Attend Webinars or Online Courses**: Enroll in online courses or webinars, such as those offered by Neuromatch Academy or the Computational Psychiatry course, to learn from experts and network with peers[3].

#### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)

**Advanced Topics to Explore:**
- **Predictive Planning and Counterfactual Learning**: Dive into more advanced decision-making schemes in Active Inference, such as predictive planning and counterfactual learning, to enhance your understanding of sophisticated planning and decision-making[4].
- **Transfer Learning in Active Inference**: Explore the concept of transfer learning in Active Inference, including the novel modelling strategies proposed in recent research, to understand how knowledge can be transferred across tasks[5].

**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**
- **Collaborate with Researchers**: Reach out to researchers like Beren Millidge, Alexander Tschantz, or Anil K Seth to discuss potential collaboration opportunities or seek guidance on advanced topics.
- **Participate in Hackathons or Research Projects**: Join hackathons or research projects focused on Active Inference to work with others who have diverse expertise and gain practical experience.

**Application Projects in Their Domain:**
- **Advance the Cat Agent Project**: Apply the advanced concepts learned to enhance the cat agent project, incorporating predictive planning, counterfactual learning, and transfer learning to make the agent more sophisticated.
- **Explore Real-World Applications**: Investigate real-world applications of Active Inference, such as in robotics or autonomous systems, and consider how the principles can be applied to these domains.

**Skill-Building Activities:**
- **Programming Skills**: Enhance your programming skills in languages like MATLAB, Python, or R, focusing on implementing Active Inference models and simulations.
