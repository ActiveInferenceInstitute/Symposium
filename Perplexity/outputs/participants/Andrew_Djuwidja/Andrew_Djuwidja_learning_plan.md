### Personalized Learning Plan for Andrew Djuwidja on Active Inference

#### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Introductory Videos:**
  - Start with the Active Inference Institute's YouTube channel, particularly videos featuring John Vervaeke and Alex Kiefer. These videos provide intuitive explanations of Active Inference concepts[1].
  - Watch the introductory videos on the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference from Jared Tumiel's blog post "Spinning Up in Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle"[4].

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the basic principles of Active Inference, including the free energy principle and the role of generative models.
- Grasp the distinction between goal-directed and habitual behavior in Active Inference.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Spend 2-3 hours watching introductory videos and reading the initial sections of Jared Tumiel's blog post.
- Take notes on key concepts such as the free energy principle, Bayesian inference, and the difference between epistemic and pragmatic behavior.
- Join online forums or discussion groups related to Active Inference to ask questions and clarify any doubts.

#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Generative Models:** Understand how generative models are used in Active Inference to infer the causes of sensory data.
- **Bayesian Inference:** Learn the basics of Bayesian inference and how it is applied in Active Inference.
- **Epistemic and Pragmatic Behavior:** Understand the roles of epistemic (ambiguity-resolving) and pragmatic (reward-seeking) behavior in Active Inference[2].

**Practical Exercises or Projects:**
- Implement a simple Active Inference agent using Python or another programming language. Use libraries such as `pytorch` or `tensorflow` to create a basic generative model.
- Use the Neuromatch Academy's summer school materials to practice setting up experiments and designing simulations in computational neuroscience[4].

**Recommended Study Materials:**
- **Textbook:**
  - "Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms" by David MacKay. This textbook provides detailed explanations of information theory and Bayesian inference, which are crucial for understanding Active Inference[4].
- **Academic Papers:**
  - Read the paper "Active inference and learning" to understand the distinction between goal-directed and habitual behavior and how they are contextualized in Active Inference[2].
  - Study the paper "A neural active inference model of perceptual-motor learning" to see how Active Inference is applied in more complex tasks like locomotor interception[5].

**Community Engagement Opportunities:**
- Participate in the Active Inference Institute's online forums and discussions.
- Attend webinars or online lectures hosted by the institute or related organizations.
- Join the Neuromatch Academy's community to connect with other researchers and learners in computational neuroscience.

#### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)

**Advanced Topics to Explore:**
- **Hybrid Active Inference Models:** Learn about the integration of discrete and continuous variables in Active Inference, as discussed in the paper "Learning in Hybrid Active Inference Models"[3].
- **Deep Learning and Active Inference:** Study how deep neural networks can be used to scale Active Inference, as described in Beren's blog post on scaling Active Inference using deep neural network methods[1].

**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**
- Collaborate with other researchers or interns working on similar projects to share insights and best practices.
- Reach out to experts like Alex Kiefer for guidance on specific aspects of Active Inference.

**Application Projects in Their Domain:**
- Apply Active Inference to the "cat agent" project by integrating more sophisticated generative models and exploring the use of hybrid models.
- Experiment with different scenarios to see how the agent's behavior changes under various conditions.

**Skill-Building Activities:**
- Take online courses in computational neuroscience and machine learning to deepen your understanding of the underlying concepts.
- Participate in hackathons or coding challenges related to AI and machine learning to practice implementing Active Inference in different contexts.
