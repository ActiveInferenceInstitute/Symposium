These videos provide intuitive explanations of Active Inference concepts[1].\n  - Watch the introductory videos on the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference from Jared Tumiel's blog post \"Spinning Up in Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle\"[4].\n\n**Initial Learning Objectives:**\n- Understand the basic principles of Active Inference, including the free energy principle and the role of generative models.\n- Grasp the distinction between goal-directed and habitual behavior in Active Inference.\n\n**Concrete Actions to Take:**\n- Spend 2-3 hours watching introductory videos and reading the initial sections of Jared Tumiel's blog post.\n- Take notes on key concepts such as the free energy principle, Bayesian inference, and the difference between epistemic and pragmatic behavior.\n- Join online forums or discussion groups related to Active Inference to ask questions and clarify any doubts.\n\n#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)\n\n**Key Concepts to Master:**\n- **Generative Models:** Understand how generative models are used in Active Inference to infer the causes of sensory data.\n- **Bayesian Inference:** Learn the basics of Bayesian inference and how it is applied in Active Inference.\n- **Epistemic and Pragmatic Behavior:** Understand the roles of epistemic (ambiguity-resolving) and pragmatic (reward-seeking) behavior in Active Inference[2].\n\n**Practical Exercises or Projects:**\n- Implement a simple Active Inference agent using Python or another programming language. Use libraries such as `pytorch` or `tensorflow` to create a basic generative model.\n- Use the Neuromatch Academy's summer school materials to practice setting up experiments and designing simulations in computational neuroscience[4].\n\n**Recommended Study Materials:**\n- **Textbook:**\n  - \"Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms\" by David MacKay. This textbook provides detailed explanations of information theory and Bayesian inference, which are crucial for understanding Active Inference[4].\n- **Academic Papers:**\n  - Read the paper \"Active inference and learning\" to understand the distinction between goal-directed and habitual behavior and how they are contextualized in Active Inference[2].\n  - Study the paper \"A neural active inference model of perceptual-motor learning\" to see how Active Inference is applied in more complex tasks like locomotor interception[5].\n\n**Community Engagement Opportunities:**\n- Participate in the Active Inference Institute's online forums and discussions.\n- Attend webinars or online lectures hosted by the institute or related organizations.\n- Join the Neuromatch Academy's community to connect with other researchers and learners in computational neuroscience.\n\n#### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)\n\n**Advanced Topics to Explore:**\n- **Hybrid Active Inference Models:** Learn about the integration of discrete and continuous variables in Active Inference, as discussed in the paper \"Learning in Hybrid Active Inference Models\"[3].\n- **Deep Learning and Active Inference:** Study how deep neural networks can be used to scale Active Inference, as described in Beren's blog post on scaling Active Inference using deep neural network methods[1].\n\n**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**\n- Collaborate with other researchers or interns working on similar projects to share insights and best practices.\n- Reach out to experts like Alex Kiefer for guidance on specific aspects of Active Inference.\n\n**Application Projects in Their Domain:**\n- Apply Active Inference to the \"cat agent\" project by integrating more sophisticated generative models and exploring the use of hybrid models.\n- Experiment with different scenarios to see how the agent's behavior changes under various conditions.\n\n**Skill-Building Activities:**\n- Take online courses in computational neuroscience and machine learning to deepen your understanding of the underlying concepts.\n- Participate in hackathons or coding challenges related to AI and machine learning to practice implementing Active Inference in different contexts.\n\n#### SPECIFIC RESOURCES\n\n**Active Inference Institute Materials:**\n- YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4y4UEKkmR1sX9l7-JZ5uFw\n- Blog posts and articles: Check the institute's website for various resources and explanations.\n\n**Academic Papers and Tutorials:**\n- \"Active inference and learning\": https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27375276/\n- \"Learning in Hybrid Active Inference Models\": https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01066\n- \"A neural active inference model of perceptual-motor learning\": https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computational-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncom.2023.1099593/full\n\n**Software Tools and Frameworks:**\n- PyTorch or TensorFlow for implementing generative models.\n- rSLDS (recurrent switching linear dynamical systems) for learning discrete representations in continuous dynamics[3].\n\n**Community Resources and Events:**\n- Neuromatch Academy: https://academy.neuromatch.io/\n- Active Inference Institute's online forums and webinars.\n- Computational Neuroscience \u2018Imbizo\u2019 in Muizenburg, South Africa (if possible)[4].\n\n#### PROGRESS TRACKING\n\n**Milestones and Checkpoints:**\n- After 1 week: Understand the basic principles of Active Inference and complete the introductory videos and readings.\n- After 1 month: Implement a simple Active Inference agent and participate in online discussions.\n- After 3 months: Complete the reading of key papers and start exploring advanced topics like hybrid models.\n\n**Self-Assessment Methods:**\n- Keep a learning journal to track progress and note any challenges.\n- Regularly review and summarize the key concepts learned.\n- Evaluate the performance of the implemented agents and adjust the models accordingly.\n\n**Practical Application Opportunities:**\n- Continuously apply the learned concepts to the \"cat agent\" project.\n- Participate in coding challenges or hackathons to practice implementing Active Inference in various scenarios.\n- Present the progress and findings in a small group or online community to receive feedback and insights.\n\nBy following this structured learning plan, Andrew Djuwidja can gradually deepen his understanding of Active Inference, apply it effectively in his projects, and engage with the broader community to enhance his learning experience.",
