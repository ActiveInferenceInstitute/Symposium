### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Active Inference in Multimodal Human-Computer Interaction

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and implement a simple Active Inference model to enhance multimodal human-computer interaction, focusing on selecting the most informative modalities for effective communication.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, human-computer interaction often relies on predefined rules or passive perception methods, which may not optimize the use of available multimodal signals (e.g., visual, auditory, tactile). These methods can be limited by their inability to dynamically adapt to changing contexts and user needs, leading to less efficient and less engaging interactions.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will employ an energy minimization approach based on the free energy principle, as outlined in the study "Active Inference Through Energy Minimization in Multimodal Humanâ€“Robot Interaction"[1]. By using a multimodal deep belief network to represent the relationships between emotional states and multimodal sensory signals, the model can actively select the most informative modalities to minimize uncertainty and improve interaction accuracy.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of human-computer interactions, particularly in scenarios where multimodal feedback is crucial, such as in virtual assistance, educational tools, or accessibility technologies. This can enhance user experience, reduce errors, and increase the overall usability of interactive systems.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- Technical challenges in implementing and optimizing the energy-based model.
- Limited access to diverse multimodal datasets for training and testing.
- Potential user resistance to new interaction paradigms.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project will primarily require computational resources and access to relevant software tools (e.g., MATLAB, PyTorch). Given the small scope, the costs are expected to be minimal, likely within the range of $1,000 to $5,000, depending on the specific tools and datasets used.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 1-2 months to complete, including literature review, model implementation, and initial testing.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Week 1-2:** Complete literature review and develop a detailed project plan.
- **Week 3-4:** Implement the basic Active Inference model using existing libraries and frameworks.
- **Week 5-6:** Test the model with a small dataset and evaluate its performance.
- **Final Checkpoint:** Present the results, including any challenges faced and future directions for expansion.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with Reinforcement Learning for Decision-Making

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop an integrated model that combines Active Inference with reinforcement learning to enhance decision-making processes in managerial contexts.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current decision-making models often rely on either Active Inference for perceptual inference or reinforcement learning for action selection, but they are not typically integrated. This separation can lead to suboptimal decisions, as the models do not fully consider the dynamic interplay between perception and action.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will integrate Active Inference models, which optimize perceptual inference through energy minimization, with reinforcement learning frameworks that optimize action selection. By leveraging the theoretical underpinnings of Active Inference and the practical advantages of reinforcement learning, the model can dynamically adjust to new information and make more informed decisions[1][3].

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will significantly impact managerial decision-making by providing a more comprehensive and adaptive framework. This can lead to better resource allocation, improved risk management, and enhanced overall performance in organizational settings.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- Integrating two complex frameworks can introduce additional technical challenges.
- The need for extensive datasets to train and validate the integrated model.
- Potential resistance from stakeholders due to the novelty of the approach.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The costs will include computational resources, software tools, and potentially hiring a research assistant. The estimated budget is between $10,000 to $30,000, depending on the scope and resources required.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 3-6 months to complete, including literature review, model development, testing, and validation.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Month 1:** Complete literature review and develop a detailed project plan.
- **Month 2-3:** Implement the integrated model using relevant libraries and frameworks.
- **Month 4-5:** Test the model with simulated and real-world datasets.
- **Final Checkpoint:** Present the results, including any challenges faced, and discuss future directions for application and refinement.

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing a General Framework for Active Inference in Interdisciplinary Applications

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a general framework for applying Active Inference across various interdisciplinary fields, including neuroscience, psychology, artificial intelligence, and management.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current applications of Active Inference are often domain-specific, lacking a unified framework that can be adapted across different fields. This limits the broader impact and applicability of Active Inference.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will involve creating a modular and adaptable framework that integrates the core principles of Active Inference with domain-specific requirements. By leveraging Tinger Kwok's philosophical background to contextualize the theory and managerial experience to ensure practical feasibility, the framework can be tailored to various applications, such as emotional state inference in human-robot interaction, decision-making in management, and cognitive modeling in neuroscience[1][3].

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will revolutionize the application of Active Inference by providing a versatile and widely applicable framework. This can lead to significant advancements in fields such as AI, neuroscience, psychology, and management, enhancing our understanding of human behavior, improving AI systems, and optimizing decision-making processes.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- The complexity of developing a general framework that is both theoretically sound and practically applicable.
- The need for extensive collaboration across multiple disciplines.
- Potential challenges in securing funding and resources for such an ambitious project.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The estimated budget for this project is substantial, likely ranging from $100,000 to $500,000, depending on the scale of the research, the number of collaborators, and the resources required.

#### 7. How long will it take?
This project is expected to take approximately 1-2 years to complete, including the development of the framework, testing across various domains, and validation through case studies and pilot projects.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **6 Months:** Complete the theoretical groundwork and develop a preliminary framework.
- **12 Months:** Implement and test the framework in at least two different domains.
- **18 Months:** Conduct extensive validation and case studies across multiple fields.
- **Final Checkpoint:** Publish the framework and results in peer-reviewed journals, and present at international conferences to disseminate the findings widely.
