### Immediate Next Steps (1-2 weeks)

#### Specific Resources to Start With:
- **Tutorials and Workshops**:
  - Start with the "Spinning Up in Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle" syllabus by Jared Tumiel. This resource provides a structured approach to learning Active Inference, including prerequisites and a hierarchy of materials[2].
  - Utilize the Neuromatch Academy's summer school materials, which are freely available online and cover computational neuroscience, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. This will help bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical implementation[2].

#### Initial Learning Objectives:
- Understand the core concepts of Active Inference, including Bayesian inference, generative models, and the minimization of free energy.
- Learn how to implement simple Active Inference models in Matlab.

#### Concrete Actions to Take:
- **Mathematical Foundations**:
  - Read the introductory sections of "Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms" by David MacKay to solidify understanding of Bayesian inference and information theory[2].
  - Watch the introductory videos on the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference from the syllabus provided by Jared Tumiel[2].
- **Coding in Matlab**:
  - Start with simple Matlab implementations of Active Inference models. Use tutorials or webinars from the Active Inference Institute or similar resources to guide this process.
  - Practice plotting key variables such as prediction errors and belief updates in Matlab.

### Short-Term Goals (1-3 months)

#### Key Concepts to Master:
- **Variational Inference and Free Energy**:
  - Delve deeper into the variational inference methods used in Active Inference. Study how these methods minimize free energy and how they integrate perception, action, and learning[3][5].
- **Error Dynamics and Plotting Variables**:
  - Read papers such as those by Beren Millidge to understand which variables are typically plotted in Active Inference models and why. This will help in interpreting the outputs of your models[1].

#### Practical Exercises or Projects:
- **Simple Grid-World Tasks**:
  - Implement Active Inference models for simple grid-world tasks using Matlab. Gradually increase the complexity of the tasks as you become more comfortable with the code.
- **Simulation and Experimentation**:
  - Use the Neuromatch Academy materials to set up simulations and experiments in computational neuroscience, integrating Active Inference principles[2].

#### Recommended Study Materials:
- **Books and Articles**:
  - "Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior" by Parr, Pezzulo, and Friston. This book provides a comprehensive overview of Active Inference and its applications[3].
  - "A Retrospective on Active Inference" by Beren Millidge for insights into scaling Active Inference and its relation to deep reinforcement learning[1].

#### Community Engagement Opportunities:
- **Research Groups and Workshops**:
  - Participate in online forums or discussion groups focused on Active Inference. Engage with researchers on platforms like Twitter or Reddit to get feedback on your models.
  - Attend webinars or workshops organized by the Active Inference Institute or similar entities.

### Medium-Term Development (3-6 months)

#### Advanced Topics to Explore:
- **Hybrid Active Inference Models**:
  - Study the hybrid hierarchical active inference models that integrate discrete and continuous representations. This includes work on recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS) and their application in tasks like the Continuous Mountain Car problem[4].
- **Scaling Active Inference**:
  - Investigate how to scale Active Inference models using deep neural networks. Read about the approaches taken by researchers like Beren Millidge and their outcomes[1].

#### Potential Collaboration Opportunities:
- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**:
  - Reach out to researchers with a background in 4E-cognition and phenomenology who are also working on Active Inference. Collaborate with cognitive scientists, philosophers, and neuroscientists to enrich your understanding and application of the theory.
  - Engage with John Vervaeke or similar researchers who integrate Active Inference with broader cognitive and philosophical themes.

#### Application Projects in Their Domain:
- **Computational Phenomenology**:
  - Apply Active Inference to modeling Adversarial Inference within the context of computational phenomenology. This involves integrating the enactive and embodied aspects of cognition into your models.
  - Develop models that explore the distinction between goal-directed and habitual behavior, leveraging the theoretical frameworks presented in papers on active inference and learning[5].

#### Skill-Building Activities:
- **Advanced Coding Skills**:
  - Take advanced courses or workshops on Matlab programming, focusing on optimization and visualization techniques.
  - Learn to use other tools and frameworks, such as Python libraries (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow) for implementing Active Inference models.

### Specific Resources
