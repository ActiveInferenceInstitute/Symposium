2. **Matlab Implementation:**
   - Use the resources from the Active Inference tutorials and workshops available on the [Neuromatch Academy](https://neuromatch.io/) website. Specifically, look for sessions that focus on Matlab implementation of Active Inference models[3].
   - Practice implementing simple Active Inference models in Matlab using the examples from research papers such as the one on "Learning in Hybrid Active Inference Models"[1].

3. **Initial Learning Objectives:**
   - Understand the basic mathematical concepts underlying Active Inference (Bayesian inference, free energy principle).
   - Implement a simple Active Inference model in Matlab.

**Concrete Actions:**
   - Dedicate 2 hours each day to reading and watching the recommended resources.
   - Spend 3 hours each week practicing Matlab implementation.
