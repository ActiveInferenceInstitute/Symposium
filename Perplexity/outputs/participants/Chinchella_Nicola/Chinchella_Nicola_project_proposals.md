### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Implementing Active Inference in a Simple Embodied Cognition Scenario

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Implement a simple Active Inference model to simulate decision-making and action in an embodied cognition scenario, such as a robot navigating a small environment.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, Active Inference models are often implemented in abstract or grid-world environments. However, there is a lack of practical examples that integrate embodied and enactive cognitive frameworks. The limits of current practice include the complexity of modeling continuous and discrete variables simultaneously and the scarcity of examples that demonstrate the application of Active Inference in real-world, embodied scenarios.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will use Matlab to implement an Active Inference model that incorporates both discrete and continuous variables, simulating an embodied agent navigating a simple environment. The new approach involves using hybrid active inference models to integrate high-level discrete planning with low-level continuous control. This will be successful because it leverages Nicola's background in 4E-cognition and provides a practical, hands-on example that can be scaled up.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will provide a tangible example of how Active Inference can be applied to embodied cognition, making it more accessible to researchers in cognitive science and philosophy. It will also contribute to the development of more realistic models of cognitive processes.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risks include the technical challenges of integrating discrete and continuous variables and the potential for the model to be overly simplistic, failing to capture the complexity of real-world scenarios.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will primarily require time and computational resources, which are already available through Nicola's current setup. There are no additional costs anticipated.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take approximately 2-3 months to complete, given the current level of expertise and resources.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point (1 month):** Successful implementation of the basic Active Inference model in Matlab.
- **Final Check Point (3 months):** Completion of the hybrid model integrating discrete and continuous variables, with a functional simulation of the embodied agent.

**Resources and Collaborators:**
- Utilize resources from the Neuromatch Academy and the Active Inference Institute.
- Collaborate with researchers from cognitive science and philosophy to ensure the model aligns with theoretical frameworks.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Applying Active Inference to Decision-Making in Enactive Cognitive Frameworks

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop an Active Inference model to study decision-making processes in enactive cognitive frameworks, focusing on how agents perceive, act, and make decisions in dynamic environments.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current models of decision-making often rely on abstract representations and do not fully incorporate the enactive perspective, which emphasizes the agent's active engagement with the environment. The limits include the lack of empirical validation and the complexity of modeling the agent-environment loop.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will use advanced Active Inference techniques, such as hybrid active inference models, to simulate decision-making in enactive cognitive frameworks. The new approach involves integrating epistemic and pragmatic behaviors within the model, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of decision-making processes. This will be successful because it leverages Nicola's expertise in 4E-cognition and the practical application of Active Inference.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will contribute significantly to the understanding of decision-making in enactive cognitive frameworks, providing insights that can be applied in various fields such as cognitive science, philosophy, and robotics. It will also enhance the practical applicability of Active Inference.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risks include the complexity of modeling the agent-environment loop, the need for empirical validation, and the potential for the model to be too complex to yield meaningful insights.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project may require additional computational resources and possibly collaboration with other researchers, which could involve some travel or workshop participation costs.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take approximately 6 months to complete, considering the need for deeper theoretical understanding and practical implementation.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point (3 months):** Successful implementation of the basic Active Inference model for decision-making in an enactive framework.
- **Final Check Point (6 months):** Completion of the hybrid model with empirical validation and a comprehensive analysis of the decision-making processes.

**Resources and Collaborators:**
- Utilize resources from the Computational Psychiatry course and the Active Inference Institute.
- Collaborate with researchers in cognitive science, philosophy, and robotics to ensure a multidisciplinary approach.

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing a Scalable Active Inference Framework for Complex Cognitive Processes

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a scalable Active Inference framework that can model complex cognitive processes, including perception, action, and decision-making, in both embodied and enactive cognitive frameworks. This framework should be capable of handling real-world, dynamic environments.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current Active Inference models are often limited to discrete grid-worlds or simple environments. The scalability to more complex, real-world environments is a significant challenge. The limits include the computational complexity, the need for advanced modeling techniques, and the lack of strong empirical neuroscientific backing.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will integrate advanced modeling techniques such as deep neural networks and hybrid active inference models to create a scalable framework. The new approach involves leveraging recent advancements in machine learning and computational neuroscience to handle complex environments. This will be successful because it combines Nicola's theoretical background with practical implementation skills and collaboration with experts in advanced modeling techniques.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will revolutionize the field of Active Inference by providing a scalable framework that can be applied to a wide range of cognitive processes. It will make a significant difference in fields such as cognitive science, philosophy, robotics, and computational neuroscience.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The primary risks include the high computational complexity, the need for significant resources and collaboration, and the potential for the model to be too complex to yield meaningful insights.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require significant computational resources, possibly additional funding for travel and workshops, and collaboration with other researchers, which could involve some costs.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take approximately 12-18 months to complete, given the scope and the need for extensive research and development.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point (6 months):** Successful implementation of the basic scalable Active Inference framework using deep neural networks.

**Resources and Collaborators:**
- Utilize resources from the Active Inference Institute, Neuromatch Academy, and computational neuroscience courses.
