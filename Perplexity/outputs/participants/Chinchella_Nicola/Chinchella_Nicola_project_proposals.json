What are you trying to do?\nImplement simple Active Inference models in Matlab to solve basic grid-world tasks, such as navigating a grid to reach a goal while minimizing free energy.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrently, Active Inference models are often implemented in discrete state-spaces using categorical distributions and transition matrices. However, the transition from theoretical understanding to practical implementation in Matlab can be challenging, especially for those new to the field. The limits include the complexity of translating mathematical concepts into code and the need for clear guidance on which variables to plot and interpret.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project will start with a structured approach using the \"Spinning Up in Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle\" syllabus by Jared Tumiel. It will leverage tutorials and workshops to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical coding. By focusing on simple grid-world tasks, the project will gradually build complexity, allowing for a solid foundation in both the theory and the coding aspects of Active Inference.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nSuccess in this project will provide Chinchella Nicola with practical skills in implementing Active Inference models, enabling them to apply the theory to more complex tasks and contribute to the field. It will also serve as a foundational step for more advanced projects, such as scaling Active Inference using deep neural networks.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\nThe primary risks include the difficulty in translating mathematical concepts into Matlab code and the potential for misunderstandings in plotting and interpreting key variables. However, these risks can be mitigated by using detailed tutorials and seeking feedback from peers and experts.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThis project will not incur significant costs beyond the time and effort of the researcher. It will utilize freely available resources such as the \"Spinning Up in Active Inference\" syllabus and Neuromatch Academy materials.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\nThis project is expected to take 1-2 weeks to complete the initial implementation and 1-3 months to refine and expand the models to more complex grid-world tasks.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Weekly Progress Meetings**: Schedule weekly meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and insights.\n- **Monthly Review**: Conduct a monthly review to assess the learning objectives achieved and adjust the plan as necessary.\n- **Mid-term Checkpoint**: After 1 month, evaluate the ability to implement simple Active Inference models and plot key variables correctly.\n- **Final Checkpoint**: After 3 months, assess the ability to handle more complex grid-world tasks and the overall proficiency in using Active Inference in Matlab.\n\n### Project Proposal 2: Scaling Active Inference Models Using Deep Neural Networks\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nScale Active Inference models from discrete state-spaces to more complex tasks using deep neural networks, enabling the application of Active Inference to a broader range of problems.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrently, Active Inference is often restricted to discrete grid-world environments due to the analytical solvability of these models. Scaling these models to more complex tasks is challenging and typically involves using deep reinforcement learning techniques. The limits include the need for advanced mathematical and coding skills, as well as the lack of clear guidelines on how to integrate deep neural networks with Active Inference.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project will leverage the work of researchers like Beren Millidge, who have successfully scaled Active Inference using deep neural networks. By using resources such as \"A Retrospective on Active Inference\" and the \"Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior\" book, Nicola will gain insights into how to parametrize distributions using deep neural networks and integrate them into Active Inference models. The project will also involve collaboration with experts in deep reinforcement learning to ensure the models are optimized and scalable.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nSuccess in scaling Active Inference models will significantly expand the applicability of the theory, allowing it to be used in more complex real-world tasks. This will make a substantial difference in fields such as cognitive science, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence, enabling more sophisticated decision-making and action selection models.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\nThe risks include the complexity of integrating deep neural networks with Active Inference, potential computational challenges, and the need for advanced coding skills. However, these risks can be mitigated by collaborating with experts and using well-documented resources.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThis project may require access to computational resources and potentially some funding for attending workshops or conferences. However, the primary cost will be the time and effort of the researcher.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\nThis project is expected to take 3-6 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the tasks and the depth of the integration.\n\n#### 8.

What are you trying to do?\nIntegrate Active Inference with computational phenomenology to model Adversarial Inference, exploring how embodied and enactive aspects of cognition influence decision-making and action selection in adversarial scenarios.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrently, Active Inference is primarily applied to decision-making and action selection in non-adversarial contexts. Integrating it with computational phenomenology to model Adversarial Inference is a novel approach that requires a deep understanding of both the theoretical frameworks and the practical implementation. The limits include the lack of existing models that combine these two areas and the complexity of modeling adversarial scenarios.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project will leverage Nicola's background in 4E-cognition and phenomenology to integrate the enactive and embodied aspects of cognition into Active Inference models. By using resources such as \"Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior\" and collaborating with researchers like John Vervaeke, Nicola will develop models that capture the essence of Adversarial Inference in a computationally phenomenological context. The project will also involve simulating and experimenting with these models using computational neuroscience tools.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nSuccess in this project will provide a novel framework for understanding decision-making and action selection in adversarial scenarios, combining the strengths of Active Inference and computational phenomenology. This will make a significant difference in fields such as cognitive science, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence, particularly in areas like game theory and adversarial decision-making.\n\n#### 5.
