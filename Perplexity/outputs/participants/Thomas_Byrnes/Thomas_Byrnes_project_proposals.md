### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Simulating Active Inference in Simple Perception Tasks

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create a simple simulation to demonstrate how active inference works in basic perception tasks, such as predicting sensory input based on actions.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, simulations of active inference often require advanced programming skills and a deep understanding of probabilistic inference and dynamical systems. The limits include the complexity of setting up these models and the need for significant computational resources.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will use accessible programming tools like MATLAB or Python, along with pre-existing libraries and tutorials, to simplify the process of setting up and running active inference simulations. By focusing on a simple perception task, the project aims to make the concept more tangible and easier to understand.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will provide a clear, hands-on understanding of active inference for Thomas Byrnes and potentially others interested in the field. It will serve as a foundational step in applying active inference to more complex tasks and can be used as an educational tool to introduce others to the concept.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the potential difficulty in translating theoretical concepts into practical simulations and the possibility of encountering computational limitations. However, these risks can be mitigated by starting with simple models and gradually increasing complexity.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project should be low-cost, as it primarily involves using free or low-cost software tools and online resources.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take about 1-2 months to complete, depending on the depth of the simulations and the frequency of work.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Week 1-2:** Set up the basic simulation framework using MATLAB or Python.
- **Week 3-4:** Implement a simple active inference model for a basic perception task.
- **Week 5-8:** Run simulations, analyze results, and document findings.
- **Final Checkpoint:** Present the simulation and results in a clear, understandable format.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with AI Systems for Enhanced Alignment

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Integrate active inference principles into an AI system to enhance its alignment and robustness, particularly in model-based reinforcement learning.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, AI systems often use model-based reinforcement learning without fully incorporating active inference principles. The limits include the lack of a unified framework that integrates active inference with AI, leading to potential misalignment and robustness issues.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will leverage recent advancements in active inference and AI alignment theory to develop a more integrated framework. By using generative models and the free energy principle, the AI system can better align with human values and adapt to changing environments.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will contribute to the development of more aligned and robust AI systems, which is crucial for AI safety and ethical considerations. It will also advance the understanding of how active inference can be applied in practical AI applications.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of integrating two complex theories (active inference and model-based reinforcement learning), potential computational challenges, and the need for extensive testing to ensure alignment.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project may require access to more advanced computational resources and possibly collaboration with other researchers, which could incur some costs. However, these costs can be managed through grants or institutional support.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take about 6-9 months to complete, depending on the scope and the availability of resources.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Month 1-2:** Review and integrate relevant literature on active inference and AI alignment.
- **Month 3-4:** Develop a preliminary framework for integrating active inference into an AI system.
- **Month 5-6:** Implement and test the integrated system on simple tasks.
- **Month 7-9:** Refine the system, conduct extensive testing, and document results.
- **Final Checkpoint:** Present the integrated AI system and its performance in a clear, technical report.

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing Clinical Applications of Active Inference for Neurological Disorders

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop clinical applications of active inference to better understand and treat neurological or psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia or anxiety disorders.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, treatments for neurological disorders often lack a unified theoretical framework that integrates cognitive, emotional, and physiological processes. The limits include the lack of a clear mechanistic understanding of these disorders and the limited effectiveness of current treatments.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will apply the principles of active inference, particularly the free energy principle and generative models, to understand the underlying mechanisms of neurological disorders. By integrating interoceptive inference and hierarchical models, the project aims to provide a more comprehensive and mechanistic approach to diagnosis and treatment.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will lead to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of neurological disorders and potentially more effective treatments. This could significantly improve the quality of life for individuals suffering from these conditions.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of translating theoretical concepts into clinical practice, the need for extensive empirical validation, and potential ethical considerations in clinical trials.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will likely require significant funding to support clinical trials, data collection, and collaboration with clinical researchers.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take about 1-2 years to complete, depending on the scope and the complexity of the clinical trials.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Month 1-6:** Review and integrate relevant literature on active inference and neurological disorders.
- **Month 7-12:** Develop a preliminary framework for applying active inference to clinical settings.
- **Month 13-18:** Conduct pilot studies and initial clinical trials.
- **Month 19-24:** Refine the approach based on initial results, conduct larger-scale clinical trials, and document findings.
- **Final Checkpoint:** Present the clinical applications and results in a comprehensive, peer-reviewed publication.
