### Personalized Learning Plan for Dean Tickles: Active Inference

#### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Active Inference Textbook Group**: Register for the upcoming Cohort 7 or continue with Cohort 6, starting on July 15th. This will provide a structured learning environment and access to additional informal Math Group sessions and RxInfer.jl usage[3].
- **Livestreams and Webinars**: Participate in the upcoming Applied Active Inference Symposium (November 13-14, 2024) to get updated on the latest developments and applications in Active Inference[4].

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Gain a deeper understanding of the mathematical foundations of Active Inference.
- Familiarize yourself with the current research and applications within the Active Inference community.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Review the basics of Active Inference through resources like the "Active Inference Framework" section in the paper by Karl Friston and others. Focus on key concepts such as predictive processing, generative models, and variational free energy[2].
- Engage in the MathArtStream series, particularly sessions like "Mathematical Foundations for a Compositional Account of Active Inference" to enhance mathematical understanding[4].

#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Generative Models and Inference**: Understand how generative models are specified in terms of probabilistic beliefs about observations and states of the world. Delve into the process of inference and how it relates to variational free energy[2].
- **Planning and Counterfactual Learning**: Study the decision-making schemes such as DPEFE and CL methods, and how they are integrated in a mixed model. Use examples from environments like the Cart Pole and maze tasks[1].

**Practical Exercises or Projects:**
- **Simulation Tasks**: Use OpenAI Gym tasks (e.g., Cart Pole) to implement and experiment with different decision-making schemes in Active Inference. This can be done using RxInfer.jl or other relevant software tools[1][3].
- **Educational Content Development**: Collaborate with the Textbook Group to develop educational materials and exercises that integrate Active Inference concepts with educational pedagogy.

**Recommended Study Materials:**
- **Academic Papers**:
  - The paper on "Predictive Planning and Counterfactual Learning in Active Inference"[1].
  - The overview of the Active Inference framework and its application to consciousness[2].
- **Textbooks and Drafts**:
  - Participate in the review and development of Sanjeev Namjoshi's upcoming textbook on the Fundamentals of Active Inference[3].

**Community Engagement Opportunities:**
- **Livestreams and Discussions**: Regularly attend and participate in livestreams, such as the MathArtStream and Insights series, to stay updated and engage with other community members[4].
- **Project Collaborations**: Join the Unifysica project or other interdisciplinary initiatives to collaborate with researchers like Ana Magdalena Hurtado, Jeff Schulman, and Hector Manrique[3].

#### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)

**Advanced Topics to Explore:**
- **Hierarchical Generative Models**: Dive deeper into the hierarchical structure of generative models and how they relate to allostatic control and self-modelling[2].
- **Interdisciplinary Applications**: Explore how Active Inference can be applied to fields such as social sciences, cognitive robotics, and negotiation strategies. Use resources from projects like the Active Agents and Action Research on Collective Foraging[3].

**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**
- **Curriculum Development**: Collaborate with Daniel Friedman, Rafael Kaufmann, and other directors to develop comprehensive educational materials and programs for the Active Inference Institute.
- **Research Projects**: Participate in or lead research projects that integrate Active Inference with educational pedagogy, such as developing new learning pathways or assessing the efficacy of Active Inference-based educational tools.

**Application Projects in Their Domain:**
- **Educational Tools**: Develop and implement educational tools or software that incorporate Active Inference principles, focusing on making complex concepts more accessible.
- **Workshops and Courses**: Organize and teach workshops or courses that apply Active Inference to educational settings, leveraging his expertise in pedagogy.
