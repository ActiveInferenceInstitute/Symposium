### Detailed Learning Plan for Dean Tickles

#### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)

**Specific Resources to Start With:**
- **Textbook Group Materials**: Begin by reviewing the materials and discussions from the Textbook Group focused on "Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior" by Thomas Parr, Giovanni Pezzulo, and Karl J. Friston. This will help reinforce his understanding of the core principles[1].
- **Math Group Sessions**: Attend the upcoming Math Group sessions and familiarize himself with RxInfer.jl, a tool used for better understanding and applying Active Inference principles[1].
- **Livestreams and GuestStreams**: Watch recent livestreams such as Livestream #057.2 with Thomas Parr on “Active Data Sampling” and GuestStream #082.2 with Robert Worden on “Three-dimensional Spatial Cognition: Bees and Bats” to get updated on various applications and discussions within the field[1].

**Initial Learning Objectives:**
- Gain a deeper understanding of the mathematical foundations of Active Inference.
- Familiarize himself with the practical tools and software used in the field.
- Enhance his knowledge of recent research and applications in Active Inference.

**Concrete Actions to Take:**
- Register for the upcoming Cohort 7 of the Textbook Group if not already registered.
- Participate in at least two Math Group sessions to understand the use of RxInfer.jl.
- Watch and take notes on at least three recent livestreams or GuestStreams.

#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)

**Key Concepts to Master:**
- **Free Energy Principle**: Delve deeper into the Free Energy Principle and its application in Active Inference. Understand how it relates to perception, action, and cognition[5].
- **Hierarchical Generative Models**: Study the concept of hierarchical generative models and how they are used in Active Inference to explain consciousness and subjectivity[5].
- **Belief Updating and Policy Optimization**: Understand the process of belief updating and policy optimization in Active Inference, including the distinction between goal-directed and habitual behavior[2].

**Practical Exercises or Projects:**
- **MathArtStream Series**: Engage with the MathArtStream series to explore complex topics visually and apply mathematical concepts to Active Inference.
- **RxInfer.jl Projects**: Complete small projects using RxInfer.jl to apply Active Inference principles to real-world scenarios.

**Recommended Study Materials:**
- **Academic Papers**: Read papers such as "Active inference and learning" to understand the distinction between goal-directed and habitual behavior and the role of epistemic and pragmatic aspects[2].
- **Active Inference Insights**: Watch more episodes of Active Inference Insights, such as the one with Chris Frith on mentalizing, schizophrenia, and consciousness[3].

**Community Engagement Opportunities:**
- **Participate in Unifysica Project Meetings**: Continue active participation in the Unifysica project meetings to collaborate with Ana Magdalena Hurtado, Jeff Schulman, and Hector Manrique.
- **Engage with Discord Channels**: Join and actively participate in the #sym-cog-robotics Discord channel to stay updated on symbolic cognitive robotics and its relation to Active Inference[1].

#### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)

**Advanced Topics to Explore:**
- **Consciousness and Subjectivity**: Dive deeper into the self-modelling theory of subjectivity within Active Inference, including the role of deep self-models and allostatic control[5].
- **Interdisciplinary Applications**: Explore applications of Active Inference in social sciences, negotiation, and cognitive robotics. For example, look into Susan Hasty’s work on AI-assisted negotiation tools comparing Reinforcement Learning with Active Inference[1].

**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**
- **Collaborate with Daniel Friedman**: Work with Daniel Friedman on educational initiatives and developing new educational materials that integrate Active Inference principles with other disciplines.
- **Contribute to Active Agents Project**: Contribute to the “Active Agents: An Active Inference Approach to Agent-Based Modeling in the Social Sciences” project, led by Andrew Pashea, to develop open-source deliverables and tutorials[1].

**Application Projects in Their Domain:**
- **Educational Program Development**: Develop and implement new educational programs or modules that integrate Active Inference principles, leveraging his expertise in pedagogy and education.
- **Community Workshops**: Organize and lead community workshops or webinars on applying Active Inference in educational settings.

**Skill-Building Activities:**
- **Technical Writing**: Write articles or blog posts on the educational applications of Active Inference to enhance his technical writing skills and contribute to the community.
- **Tutorial Development**: Develop and publish tutorials on using RxInfer.jl and other tools for educational purposes.

#### SPECIFIC RESOURCES
