  "content": "### Project Proposal 1: Developing Educational Modules for Active Inference\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nDevelop and implement new educational modules that integrate Active Inference principles, making the theory more accessible and understandable for a broader audience, particularly in educational settings.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrently, educational materials for Active Inference are largely technical and geared towards researchers and advanced students. The limits include the complexity of the material, which can be a barrier for newcomers, and the lack of practical, hands-on learning resources.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThe new approach involves creating interactive and visual learning modules that simplify the core concepts of Active Inference, such as the Free Energy Principle, hierarchical generative models, and belief updating. These modules will include practical exercises, case studies, and real-world applications to make the learning experience more engaging and relevant. This approach leverages Dean Tickles' expertise in pedagogy and education to ensure the materials are both informative and user-friendly.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nEducators, students, and researchers interested in Active Inference will benefit from these modules. Success will make Active Inference more accessible, enhancing the understanding and adoption of the theory across various disciplines. It will also support the Active Inference Institute's mission to promote open science and education.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\nRisks include the potential for oversimplification of complex concepts, which could lead to misunderstandings, and the challenge of keeping the materials updated with the latest research developments.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThe primary cost will be time and effort. However, if additional resources such as software tools or external experts are needed, there may be minor financial costs involved.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\nThis project is expected to take approximately 1-3 months to complete the initial set of modules.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Mid-term Check Point:** After 6 weeks, review the draft modules with the Textbook Group and gather feedback.\n- **Final Check Point:** After 3 months, pilot the modules in a real educational setting and gather feedback from students and educators.\n\n**Collaborators/Resources:**\n- **Textbook Group:** Collaborate with the Textbook Group for feedback and additional resources.\n- **Math Group:** Use the Math Group sessions to ensure mathematical accuracy.\n- **Livestreams and GuestStreams:** Utilize recent livestreams and GuestStreams for inspiration and updates on the latest research.\n\n### Project Proposal 2: Integrating Active Inference with Social Sciences in Agent-Based Modeling\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nDevelop and implement an agent-based modeling framework that integrates Active Inference principles with social sciences, specifically focusing on negotiation and decision-making processes.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrent agent-based models in social sciences often use Reinforcement Learning or other simpler frameworks. The limits include the lack of a comprehensive theoretical framework that accounts for the complex interactions between perception, action, and cognition, as well as the absence of a systematic approach to model human behavior in social contexts.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project will integrate Active Inference into agent-based modeling, using hierarchical generative models to simulate human decision-making and negotiation processes. This approach will leverage the Free Energy Principle to model how agents optimize their actions to minimize expected free energy, thus providing a more realistic and comprehensive framework for understanding social behavior. Collaboration with Susan Hasty on AI-assisted negotiation tools will ensure practical relevance.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nResearchers in social sciences, negotiation, and cognitive robotics will benefit from this framework. Success will provide a more nuanced understanding of human behavior in social contexts, enabling better predictions and interventions in fields like economics, psychology, and sociology.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\nRisks include the complexity of integrating Active Inference with existing social science models, potential mismatches between theoretical predictions and empirical data, and the challenge of validating the model against real-world scenarios.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThe project may require some funding for software, data collection, and potential collaborations with external experts.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\nThis project is expected to take approximately 6-9 months to complete, including model development, testing, and validation.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Mid-term Check Point:** After 3 months, review the initial model with the Unifysica project team and gather feedback.\n- **Final Check Point:** After 9 months, present the final model and its applications in a research symposium or journal publication.\n\n**Collaborators/Resources:**\n- **Susan Hasty:** Collaborate on AI-assisted negotiation tools.\n- **Unifysica Project Team:** Work with Ana Magdalena Hurtado, Jeff Schulman, and Hector Manrique.\n- **Active Inference Institute Resources:** Utilize the Institute's materials, including papers and livestreams, to ensure theoretical accuracy.\n\n### Project Proposal 3: Investigating Consciousness and Subjectivity through Active Inference\n\n#### 1. What are you trying to do?\nConduct an in-depth research project to explore the self-modelling theory of subjectivity within Active Inference, focusing on how deep self-models and allostatic control shape consciousness.\n\n#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nCurrent research on consciousness often lacks a unified theoretical framework. The limits include the fragmented understanding of how different levels of the hierarchical generative model contribute to subjective experience and the lack of systematic empirical studies to validate these theories.\n\n#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\nThis project will use Active Inference to model consciousness and subjectivity, focusing on the role of deep self-models and allostatic control. The approach will involve both theoretical development and empirical validation using techniques such as functional MRI and behavioral studies. Collaboration with experts like Karl Friston and Thomas Parr will ensure the theoretical rigor of the project.\n\n#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?\nResearchers in neuroscience, cognitive science, and philosophy of mind will benefit from this research. Success will provide a more comprehensive understanding of consciousness, which could have significant implications for fields such as psychiatry, psychology, and artificial intelligence.\n\n#### 5. What are the risks?\nRisks include the complexity of the topic, the potential for misinterpretation of empirical data, and the challenge of integrating findings from different disciplines.\n\n#### 6. How much will it cost?\nThe project may require significant funding for empirical studies, including functional MRI and behavioral experiments, as well as collaborations with external experts.\n\n#### 7. How long will it take?\nThis project is expected to take approximately 1-2 years to complete, including literature review, model development, empirical studies, and publication.\n\n#### 8. What are the mid-term and final \"check points\" to see if you're on track?\n- **Mid-term Check Point:** After 6 months, present the theoretical framework and preliminary findings at a research symposium.\n- **Final Check Point:** After 2 years, publish the final research in a peer-reviewed journal and present it at a major conference in the field.\n\n**Collaborators/Resources:**\n- **Karl Friston:** Collaborate on the theoretical aspects of Active Inference and consciousness.\n- **Thomas Parr:** Work with Thomas Parr on the mathematical foundations and empirical validation.\n- **Active Inference Institute Resources:** Utilize the Institute's materials, including papers and livestreams, to ensure theoretical accuracy and stay updated on the latest research developments.\n- **Functional MRI and Behavioral Studies:** Collaborate with researchers in neuroscience to conduct empirical studies.",
