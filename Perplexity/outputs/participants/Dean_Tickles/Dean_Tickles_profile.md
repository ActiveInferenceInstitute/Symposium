Dean Tickles is affiliated with the Active Inference Institute, where he is involved in various capacities. Here are some key points about his background:

- **Expertise**: Dean Tickles has a strong background in pedagogy and education, as indicated by his skills and expertise listed on ResearchGate. This includes teaching, learning, curriculum development, and teacher training[2].
- **Involvement at AII**: He is one of the Directors of the Active Inference Institute, as mentioned in the November 2022 newsletter. This suggests a significant level of commitment and responsibility within the organization[4].

While his expertise in education is well-documented, there is limited information on his specific technical expertise in Active Inference itself. It is clear, however, that he plays a crucial role in the educational and organizational aspects of the Institute.

### Active Inference Journey: Current Understanding and Application Stage

- **Current Involvement**: Dean Tickles is actively involved in the community of the Active Inference Institute. He participates in various projects and meetings, such as the Unifysica project, where he had weekly meetings with other members from November 2023 to May 2024[5].
- **Educational Contributions**: He is part of the Textbook Group and other educational initiatives, indicating that he is engaged in the dissemination and learning of Active Inference principles. For example, he was involved in the MathArtStream series, which explores complex topics like visualizing the 4th dimension and categorical mental imagery[1][5].

Given his role in educational programs and community engagement, it is likely that Dean Tickles has a solid understanding of the principles of Active Inference, although the depth of his technical expertise in the field may vary.

### Learning Path: Specific Needs and Potential Resources

- **Needs**: While specific learning needs are not provided, it can be inferred that continuous engagement with technical aspects of Active Inference could be beneficial. Given his educational background, he may benefit from more in-depth technical resources or workshops.
- **Resources**: The Active Inference Institute offers several resources that could help Dean Tickles deepen his understanding:
  - Participation in the Textbook Group, which focuses on the textbook “Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior” by Thomas Parr, Giovanni Pezzulo, and Karl J. Friston[3][5].
  - Engaging with the Math Group sessions and using tools like RxInfer.jl to better understand and apply Active Inference principles[5].
  - Accessing various livestreams, courses, and symposiums hosted by the Institute, which cover a wide range of topics related to Active Inference[3].

### Collaboration Potential: Possible Synergies with Other Participants/Presenters

- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Dean Tickles' background in education and his role at the Institute position him well for collaborating with other participants from diverse backgrounds. For example, his involvement in the Unifysica project with Ana Magdalena Hurtado, Jeff Schulman, and Hector Manrique showcases his ability to work in interdisciplinary teams[5].
- **Educational Initiatives**: He could collaborate with other educators and researchers, such as Daniel Friedman, Karl Friston, and other presenters in the livestreams and symposiums, to develop and enhance educational materials and programs[1][3].
- **Community Engagement**: His active participation in community meetings and projects suggests he is well-placed to facilitate and coordinate collaborations between different members of the Active Inference community.

### Challenges & Opportunities: Personal and Field-Wide Perspectives

#### Personal Challenges
- **Technical Depth**: While Dean Tickles is involved in educational and community aspects, there might be a need to deepen his technical understanding of Active Inference to fully leverage his educational expertise in this field.
- **Balancing Roles**: As a Director and an active participant in various projects, managing multiple responsibilities could be challenging.
