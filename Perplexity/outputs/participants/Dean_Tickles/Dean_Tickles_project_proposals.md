### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Developing Educational Modules for Active Inference

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create a set of educational modules and exercises that introduce the basics of Active Inference to a broader audience, particularly focusing on students and educators who are new to the field.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, educational materials for Active Inference are largely technical and often inaccessible to those without a strong background in neuroscience, mathematics, or computer science. The existing resources, such as the Active Inference Textbook Group, are valuable but may not be sufficiently structured or user-friendly for newcomers.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
- **Simplified Content**: Develop modules that break down complex Active Inference concepts into simpler, more digestible parts, using analogies and practical examples.
- **Interactive Learning**: Incorporate interactive simulations and exercises using tools like RxInfer.jl to make learning more engaging and hands-on.
- **Collaborative Development**: Work closely with the Textbook Group and other educators within the Active Inference Institute to ensure the modules are both accurate and pedagogically sound.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success in this project will make Active Inference more accessible to a wider audience, including students and educators who can integrate these concepts into their curriculum. This will help in disseminating the knowledge and applications of Active Inference more broadly.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Technical Accuracy**: Ensuring that the simplified content remains technically accurate.
- **Engagement**: Maintaining student engagement with complex theoretical material.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project will primarily utilize existing resources and collaborations within the Active Inference Institute. Any additional costs will be minimal, possibly involving software licenses or minor funding for workshops.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- **Initial Development**: 2-3 months to develop the first set of modules.
- **Pilot Testing**: 1-2 months to test the modules with a small group of students.
- **Finalization**: 1 month to finalize and refine the modules based on feedback.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint**: Completion of the initial module set and pilot testing.
- **Final Checkpoint**: Positive feedback from students and educators, and successful integration of the modules into educational curricula.

**Collaborators/Resources:**
- Active Inference Textbook Group
- RxInfer.jl software tool
- Educational workshops and feedback sessions

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference into Educational Pedagogy

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and implement a comprehensive educational program that integrates Active Inference principles into various educational settings, such as schools and universities.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, educational programs rarely incorporate Active Inference or predictive processing principles. Existing curricula lack the integration of these advanced cognitive science concepts, limiting students' exposure to cutting-edge theories in cognition and neuroscience.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
- **Curriculum Design**: Collaborate with educators to design a curriculum that seamlessly integrates Active Inference concepts into existing subjects like psychology, neuroscience, and mathematics.
- **Practical Applications**: Develop practical exercises and projects that allow students to apply Active Inference principles in real-world scenarios.
- **Assessment and Feedback**: Implement a robust assessment and feedback system to evaluate the efficacy of the program and make necessary adjustments.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success will enhance the educational experience by providing students with a deeper understanding of cognitive processes and advanced theoretical frameworks. This could lead to better academic outcomes and a more informed next generation of researchers and practitioners.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Curriculum Acceptance**: Gaining acceptance from educational institutions to integrate new content.
- **Teacher Training**: Ensuring teachers are adequately trained to teach Active Inference concepts.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project may require funding for curriculum development, teacher training programs, and potentially software licenses for educational tools. Estimated costs could range from $50,000 to $100,000.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- **Curriculum Development**: 6-9 months
- **Pilot Implementation**: 3-6 months
- **Full Implementation and Evaluation**: 1-2 years

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint**: Successful pilot implementation and positive feedback from teachers and students.
- **Final Checkpoint**: Full implementation across multiple educational institutions and positive evaluation outcomes.

**Collaborators/Resources:**
- Active Inference Institute
- Educational institutions
- Teacher training programs
- Software tools like RxInfer.jl

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing AI-Assisted Negotiation Tools Using Active Inference

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop and deploy AI-assisted negotiation tools that leverage Active Inference principles to enhance negotiation strategies in various contexts, including humanitarian crises, business negotiations, and social conflicts.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current negotiation tools and strategies often rely on reinforcement learning or other AI methods that do not fully account for the cognitive and perceptual aspects of negotiation. These tools lack the depth of understanding provided by Active Inference, which can model complex interactions and predictive processes.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
- **Active Inference Models**: Implement Active Inference models to predict and adapt to the dynamic nature of negotiations, taking into account the perceptions, actions, and cognitive states of all parties involved.
- **Hierarchical Generative Models**: Use hierarchical generative models to capture the complexity of negotiation scenarios, allowing for more accurate predictions and better decision-making.
- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Collaborate with experts in negotiation, cognitive science, and AI to ensure the tools are both theoretically sound and practically applicable.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Success will lead to more effective negotiation strategies in critical areas such as humanitarian crises, business, and social conflicts. This could result in better outcomes, reduced conflict, and improved cooperation.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Complexity of Implementation**: Integrating Active Inference into AI systems can be technically challenging.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Ensuring the tools are used ethically and do not exacerbate conflicts.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
The project will likely require significant funding for research, development, and testing. Estimated costs could range from $200,000 to $500,000 or more.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- **Research and Development**: 1-2 years
- **Prototype Testing**: 6-12 months
- **Full Deployment and Evaluation**: 1-3 years

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Checkpoint**: Successful prototype development and initial testing.
- **Final Checkpoint**: Full deployment and positive evaluation of the negotiation tools in real-world scenarios.

**Collaborators/Resources:**
- Active Inference Institute
- Experts in negotiation and cognitive science
- AI development teams
- Funding agencies and grants
- Software tools like RxInfer.jl and other AI frameworks

Each of these proposals leverages Dean Tickles' background in education and his involvement with the Active Inference Institute, while addressing the need for more accessible, practical, and impactful applications of Active Inference.
