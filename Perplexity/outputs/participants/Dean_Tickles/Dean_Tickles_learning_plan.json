  "content": "### Detailed Learning Plan for Dean Tickles\n\n#### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks)\n\n**Specific Resources to Start With:**\n- **Textbook Group Materials**: Begin by reviewing the materials and discussions from the Textbook Group focused on \"Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior\" by Thomas Parr, Giovanni Pezzulo, and Karl J. Friston. This will help reinforce his understanding of the core principles[1].\n- **Math Group Sessions**: Attend the upcoming Math Group sessions and familiarize himself with RxInfer.jl, a tool used for better understanding and applying Active Inference principles[1].\n- **Livestreams and GuestStreams**: Watch recent livestreams such as Livestream #057.2 with Thomas Parr on \u201cActive Data Sampling\u201d and GuestStream #082.2 with Robert Worden on \u201cThree-dimensional Spatial Cognition: Bees and Bats\u201d to get updated on various applications and discussions within the field[1].\n\n**Initial Learning Objectives:**\n- Gain a deeper understanding of the mathematical foundations of Active Inference.\n- Familiarize himself with the practical tools and software used in the field.\n- Enhance his knowledge of recent research and applications in Active Inference.\n\n**Concrete Actions to Take:**\n- Register for the upcoming Cohort 7 of the Textbook Group if not already registered.\n- Participate in at least two Math Group sessions to understand the use of RxInfer.jl.\n- Watch and take notes on at least three recent livestreams or GuestStreams.\n\n#### SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months)\n\n**Key Concepts to Master:**\n- **Free Energy Principle**: Delve deeper into the Free Energy Principle and its application in Active Inference. Understand how it relates to perception, action, and cognition[5].\n- **Hierarchical Generative Models**: Study the concept of hierarchical generative models and how they are used in Active Inference to explain consciousness and subjectivity[5].\n- **Belief Updating and Policy Optimization**: Understand the process of belief updating and policy optimization in Active Inference, including the distinction between goal-directed and habitual behavior[2].\n\n**Practical Exercises or Projects:**\n- **MathArtStream Series**: Engage with the MathArtStream series to explore complex topics visually and apply mathematical concepts to Active Inference.\n- **RxInfer.jl Projects**: Complete small projects using RxInfer.jl to apply Active Inference principles to real-world scenarios.\n\n**Recommended Study Materials:**\n- **Academic Papers**: Read papers such as \"Active inference and learning\" to understand the distinction between goal-directed and habitual behavior and the role of epistemic and pragmatic aspects[2].\n- **Active Inference Insights**: Watch more episodes of Active Inference Insights, such as the one with Chris Frith on mentalizing, schizophrenia, and consciousness[3].\n\n**Community Engagement Opportunities:**\n- **Participate in Unifysica Project Meetings**: Continue active participation in the Unifysica project meetings to collaborate with Ana Magdalena Hurtado, Jeff Schulman, and Hector Manrique.\n- **Engage with Discord Channels**: Join and actively participate in the #sym-cog-robotics Discord channel to stay updated on symbolic cognitive robotics and its relation to Active Inference[1].\n\n#### MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months)\n\n**Advanced Topics to Explore:**\n- **Consciousness and Subjectivity**: Dive deeper into the self-modelling theory of subjectivity within Active Inference, including the role of deep self-models and allostatic control[5].\n- **Interdisciplinary Applications**: Explore applications of Active Inference in social sciences, negotiation, and cognitive robotics. For example, look into Susan Hasty\u2019s work on AI-assisted negotiation tools comparing Reinforcement Learning with Active Inference[1].\n\n**Potential Collaboration Opportunities:**\n- **Collaborate with Daniel Friedman**: Work with Daniel Friedman on educational initiatives and developing new educational materials that integrate Active Inference principles with other disciplines.\n- **Contribute to Active Agents Project**: Contribute to the \u201cActive Agents: An Active Inference Approach to Agent-Based Modeling in the Social Sciences\u201d project, led by Andrew Pashea, to develop open-source deliverables and tutorials[1].\n\n**Application Projects in Their Domain:**\n- **Educational Program Development**: Develop and implement new educational programs or modules that integrate Active Inference principles, leveraging his expertise in pedagogy and education.\n- **Community Workshops**: Organize and lead community workshops or webinars on applying Active Inference in educational settings.\n\n**Skill-Building Activities:**\n- **Technical Writing**: Write articles or blog posts on the educational applications of Active Inference to enhance his technical writing skills and contribute to the community.\n- **Tutorial Development**: Develop and publish tutorials on using RxInfer.jl and other tools for educational purposes.\n\n#### SPECIFIC RESOURCES\n\n**Active Inference Institute Materials:**\n- **Textbook Group Resources**: Utilize the resources provided by the Textbook Group, including discussion notes and additional readings[1].\n- **Livestreams and GuestStreams**: Regularly watch and engage with the livestreams and GuestStreams hosted by the Institute[1].\n\n**Academic Papers and Tutorials:**\n- **\"Active inference and learning\"**: Read the paper to understand the distinction between goal-directed and habitual behavior[2].\n- **\"Consciousness in active inference\"**: Study the paper to understand the self-modelling theory of subjectivity within Active Inference[5].\n\n**Software Tools and Frameworks:**\n- **RxInfer.jl**: Use this tool to apply Active Inference principles to real-world scenarios and projects[1].\n\n**Community Resources and Events:**\n- **#sym-cog-robotics Discord Channel**: Engage with the community to stay updated on symbolic cognitive robotics and its relation to Active Inference[1].\n- **Unifysica Project Meetings**: Continue active participation in these meetings to collaborate with other members[1].\n\n**Domain-Specific Applications:**\n- **Active Agents Project**: Contribute to the project on agent-based modeling in the social sciences[1].\n- **AI-Assisted Negotiation Tools**: Collaborate with Susan Hasty on developing AI-assisted negotiation tools comparing Reinforcement Learning with Active Inference[1].\n\n#### PROGRESS TRACKING\n\n**Milestones and Checkpoints:**\n- **Weekly Progress Meetings**: Hold weekly meetings with a mentor or peer to discuss progress and challenges.\n- **Monthly Review Sessions**: Participate in monthly review sessions with the Textbook Group or other educational initiatives to assess understanding and application of concepts.\n\n**Self-Assessment Methods:**\n- **Reflective Journaling**: Keep a reflective journal to track his understanding and application of Active Inference principles.\n- **Peer Feedback**: Seek feedback from peers and mentors on his projects and contributions to the community.\n\n**Practical Application Opportunities:**\n- **Teaching Active Inference**: Teach a course or workshop on Active Inference to apply his knowledge and receive feedback from students.\n- **Community Projects**: Lead or participate in community projects that apply Active Inference principles to real-world problems.\n\nBy following this structured learning plan, Dean Tickles can deepen his technical understanding of Active Inference, leverage his educational expertise, and contribute significantly to the educational and community initiatives at the Active Inference Institute.",
