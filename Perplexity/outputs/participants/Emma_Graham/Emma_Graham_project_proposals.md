### Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Implementing a Simple Active Inference Algorithm

**What are you trying to do?**
- Develop and implement a basic Active Inference algorithm to understand its core principles and application in a simple machine learning context.

**How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**
- Currently, Active Inference is often implemented in complex cognitive science and neuroscience contexts, which can be daunting for beginners. The limits include the need for advanced mathematical and computational skills, and the complexity of integrating with existing machine learning frameworks.

**What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?**
- This project simplifies the implementation by focusing on a basic Active Inference algorithm using widely available machine learning libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow. By starting with a simple dataset and gradually increasing complexity, this approach makes the learning process more manageable and reduces the barrier to entry.

**Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?**
- Success in this project will provide a solid foundation for Emma Graham to understand and apply Active Inference in more complex scenarios. It will also serve as a proof-of-concept for her ability to integrate Active Inference with machine learning, which can be valuable in various research and practical applications.

**What are the risks?**
- The primary risk is the potential for misunderstandings or misimplementations of the Active Inference principles, which could lead to incorrect results. However, this risk can be mitigated by careful review of the literature and validation against existing implementations.

**How much will it cost?**
- This project will not incur significant costs as it relies on free and open-source software tools and libraries.

**How long will it take?**
- The project is expected to take approximately 2-4 weeks to complete, depending on the depth of implementation and the frequency of work sessions.

**What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?**
- **Week 1:** Complete the initial reading and understanding of the "Active Statistical Inference" paper.
- **Week 2:** Implement the basic algorithm and test it on a simple dataset.
- **Week 3-4:** Refine the implementation based on initial results and document the process.

**Potential Collaborators or Resources:**
- Online forums like Reddit's r/MachineLearning and r/AskScience.
- Tutorials and workshops available on conference websites or academic platforms.
- Libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

### Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Applying Active Inference to Cognitive Science

**What are you trying to do?**
- Apply Active Inference to a cognitive science problem, such as modeling decision-making or sensory processing, using real-world datasets or simulations.

**How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**
- Currently, Active Inference is often applied in cognitive science using complex models that require significant computational resources and expertise. The limits include the integration of theoretical models with empirical data and the scalability of these models to more complex systems.

**What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?**
- This project will leverage recent advancements in the Human Brain Project, such as the integration of brain activity simulations with physical agents, to create a more realistic and practical application of Active Inference in cognitive science[1]. By using publicly available datasets and simulation tools like EBRAINS, this approach can make the application more accessible and scalable.

**Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?**
- Success in this project will contribute to the advancement of cognitive science by providing a practical example of how Active Inference can be applied to real-world cognitive tasks. It will also demonstrate the potential of integrating Active Inference with other cognitive architectures, which could be beneficial for researchers and practitioners in the field.

**What are the risks?**
- The primary risks include the complexity of integrating Active Inference with existing cognitive models and the potential for data quality issues. However, these risks can be managed by careful data preprocessing and validation against existing studies.

**How much will it cost?**
- This project may require access to computational resources or specialized software, but it can largely be done with free and open-source tools, keeping costs minimal.

**How long will it take?**
- The project is expected to take approximately 3-6 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the model and the availability of datasets.

**What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?**
- **Month 1:** Complete the literature review and identify the dataset or simulation framework to use.

### Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing an Active Inference Framework for Robotics

**What are you trying to do?**
- Develop a comprehensive Active Inference framework for robotics, enabling robots to make intelligent decisions and adapt to dynamic environments by integrating sensory and motor control.

**How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**
- Currently, robotics often employs traditional control theories that do not fully incorporate the principles of Active Inference. The limits include the lack of integration between sensory processing, motor control, and decision-making, leading to less adaptive and less intelligent robotic behavior.

**What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?**
- This project will build on the recent advancements in Active Inference, such as those demonstrated in the Human Brain Project, to create a unified framework that integrates sensory processing, motor control, and decision-making in robotics[1]. By using techniques like structured flows on manifolds (SFM) for motion description and deep learning for plasticity, this approach can create more intelligent and adaptive robotic systems.

**Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?**
- Success in this project will revolutionize the field of robotics by enabling robots to operate more intelligently and adaptively in dynamic environments. This could have significant impacts in various industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, and autonomous vehicles.

**What are the risks?**
- The primary risks include the complexity of integrating multiple components of the framework, the potential for computational inefficiencies, and the need for extensive testing and validation. However, these risks can be managed through careful design, iterative testing, and collaboration with experts in robotics and Active Inference.

**How much will it cost?**
- This project may require significant computational resources, specialized hardware for robotics, and potential collaboration costs. However, the long-term benefits and potential applications justify the investment.

**How long will it take?**
