### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Active Inference in Simulated Decision-Making Scenarios

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Create a simple simulation to demonstrate how Active Inference can be applied in decision-making scenarios, particularly under uncertainty.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, Active Inference is often explained through complex theoretical papers and advanced mathematical models. However, there is a lack of accessible, hands-on simulations that newcomers to the field can use to understand the concept practically. The limits of current practice include the complexity of the models and the need for advanced programming skills.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will develop a user-friendly simulation using Python and libraries like `scikit-learn` and `matplotlib`. The simulation will allow users to interact with a simple decision-making environment where an agent uses Active Inference to make decisions based on uncertainty. This approach is new because it simplifies the concept into an interactive tool, making it easier for beginners to understand and apply Active Inference.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will benefit new researchers and students in the field of cognitive science and neuroscience by providing a tangible way to learn Active Inference. It will make the concept more accessible and engaging, potentially increasing the number of people interested in and working on Active Inference.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of simplifying the Active Inference model without losing its core principles, and ensuring the simulation is robust and user-friendly. There is also the risk that the simulation might not accurately represent the full capabilities of Active Inference.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project should be low-cost, as it will primarily involve coding and using open-source libraries. No significant hardware or software investments are required.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take about 4-6 weeks to complete, depending on the complexity of the simulation and the amount of time dedicated to it each week.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Week 1-2:** Define the scope of the simulation and identify the necessary libraries and tools.
- **Week 3-4:** Implement the basic Active Inference algorithm and create a simple decision-making environment.
- **Week 5-6:** Test the simulation, gather feedback, and make necessary adjustments.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Integrating Active Inference with Robotics for Object Manipulation

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a project that integrates Active Inference with robotics to enhance the ability of a robotic hand to perform object manipulation tasks, similar to human-like behavior.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, robotic object manipulation is often achieved through traditional machine learning and control algorithms. However, these methods lack the adaptive and decision-making capabilities that Active Inference can offer. The limits include the inability to handle uncertainty and adapt to new situations dynamically.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will use the concepts of Active Inference to create a robotic system that can adaptively learn and make decisions during object manipulation tasks. By integrating Active Inference with robotics, the system will be able to handle uncertainty and make more informed decisions, similar to human behavior. This approach is new because it applies Active Inference in a real-world robotic setting, leveraging its potential for adaptive learning and decision-making.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will benefit the fields of robotics and cognitive science by providing a more adaptive and intelligent robotic system. It will have practical applications in industries such as manufacturing and healthcare, where robotic systems need to perform complex tasks with precision and adaptability.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the technical challenges of integrating Active Inference with robotic systems, ensuring the system's stability and reliability, and addressing potential ethical concerns related to autonomous decision-making.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require moderate resources, including access to robotic hardware, software tools like TensorFlow or PyTorch, and possibly collaboration with robotics experts.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take about 6-9 months to complete, depending on the complexity of the integration and the availability of resources.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Month 1-2:** Define the scope of the project, identify necessary hardware and software, and establish a baseline robotic system.
- **Month 3-4:** Implement the Active Inference algorithm and integrate it with the robotic system.
- **Month 5-6:** Test the integrated system, gather feedback, and make necessary adjustments.
- **Month 7-9:** Finalize the system, document the process, and prepare for potential publication or presentation.

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Developing a Cognitive Architecture for Personalized Brain Network Models Using Active Inference

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a cognitive architecture that uses Active Inference to create personalized brain network models, integrating data from various neurophysiological and brain structural connectivity sources.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Currently, brain network models are often created using static datasets and lack the dynamic adaptability that Active Inference can provide. The limits include the inability to incorporate real-time data and adapt to individual variations in brain function.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will leverage the Human Brain Project's (HBP) infrastructure and tools, such as the EBRAINS platform, to integrate Active Inference with advanced neuroimaging and connectivity data. By using Active Inference, the system will be able to adaptively learn and update brain network models based on individual data, providing more accurate and personalized models. This approach is new because it combines cutting-edge neuroimaging techniques with the adaptive capabilities of Active Inference.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
This project will significantly impact the fields of neuroscience and cognitive science by providing personalized and dynamic brain network models. It will have practical applications in clinical psychology, neurology, and personalized medicine, enabling better diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders.

#### 5. What are the risks?
The main risks include the complexity of integrating multiple data sources, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the models, and addressing ethical concerns related to personalized data.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project will require substantial resources, including access to advanced neuroimaging equipment, collaboration with experts from the HBP, and significant computational power.

#### 7. How long will it take?
The project is expected to take about 1-2 years to complete, depending on the complexity of the integration, the availability of resources, and the need for extensive testing and validation.

- **Month 1-3:** Define the scope of the project, establish collaborations with HBP and other necessary partners, and set up the initial infrastructure.
- **Month 4-6:** Integrate Active Inference with the EBRAINS platform and other neuroimaging tools.
- **Month 7-12:** Test and validate the system using a small cohort of participants.
- **Month 13-24:** Expand the system to larger cohorts, refine the models, and prepare for publication and presentation.
