## Personalized Learning Plan for Sandeep Ramesh: Active Inference in High Finance

### Immediate Next Steps (1-2 weeks)

#### Specific Resources to Start With:
- **Theoretical Foundations**:
  - Start with the foundational paper by Friston et al., "Designing Ecosystems of Intelligence from First Principles" (arXiv: 2212.01354)[5].
  - Explore the Active Inference Institute's publications and introductory materials.
- **Blog and Field Notes**:
  - Read Sandeep Ramesh's own Field Note #147 on "Active Inference, Sympathetic Intelligence" to align with his current understanding and interests[5].

#### Initial Learning Objectives:
- Understand the core principles of Active Inference, including the free energy principle and Bayesian inference.
- Familiarize yourself with the concept of sympathetic intelligence and its implications.

#### Concrete Actions to Take:
- Dedicate 2 hours each day for the next two weeks to reading and taking notes on the foundational papers and blog posts.
- Create a mind map or concept map to visualize the relationships between different concepts in Active Inference.

### Short-Term Goals (1-3 months)

#### Key Concepts to Master:
- **Free Energy Principle**: Delve deeper into the mathematical and theoretical aspects of the free energy principle.
- **Bayesian Inference**: Understand how Bayesian inference is applied in Active Inference.
