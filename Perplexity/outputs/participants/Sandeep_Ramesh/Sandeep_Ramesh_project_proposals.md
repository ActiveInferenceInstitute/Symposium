### Project Proposal 1: Immediate, Smaller-Scope Project - Active Inference for Simple Financial Risk Assessment

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop a basic Active Inference model to assess financial risk in a simplified investment scenario.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current financial risk assessment often relies on traditional statistical models and machine learning algorithms that may not fully capture the complexities and uncertainties of financial markets. These models can be limited by their inability to incorporate dynamic updates and contextual information effectively.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will apply the Active Inference framework, which incorporates the free energy principle and Bayesian inference, to create a model that can adapt to changing market conditions and update its predictions based on new data. This approach is new because it integrates the concept of sympathetic intelligence, allowing the model to take the perspective of other market participants and adjust its risk assessments accordingly.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Financial analysts, portfolio managers, and investors will benefit from a more robust and adaptive risk assessment tool. This could lead to better decision-making and potentially reduce financial losses due to unforeseen market fluctuations.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Model Complexity**: The model might be overly complex for the given data, leading to overfitting.
- **Data Quality**: The quality of the financial data used could affect the model's performance.
- **Interpretability**: Ensuring the model's outputs are interpretable for financial decision-makers.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project is expected to be low-cost, primarily requiring computational resources and access to financial data, which can often be obtained from public sources or through existing subscriptions.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- **Duration**: 4-6 weeks
- **Milestones**:
  - Week 1: Literature review and understanding of Active Inference basics.
  - Week 2-3: Implementation of a simple Active Inference model using PyTorch or TensorFlow.
  - Week 4-6: Testing and validation of the model with historical financial data.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: Successful implementation of the basic Active Inference model and initial testing with synthetic data.
- **Final Check Point**: Validation of the model with real-world financial data and comparison with traditional risk assessment models.

### Project Proposal 2: Medium-Term, Moderate-Scope Project - Active Inference for Portfolio Optimization

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop an Active Inference model to optimize portfolio management strategies by incorporating market volatility, risk tolerance, and dynamic updates.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current portfolio optimization techniques often use mean-variance analysis or black-box machine learning models that do not fully account for the dynamic nature of financial markets. These models can be inflexible and may not adapt well to changing market conditions.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will leverage Active Inference to create a model that continuously updates its predictions and adapts to new market data. The model will incorporate sympathetic intelligence to take into account the perspectives of other market participants, leading to more informed and adaptive portfolio optimization strategies.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Portfolio managers, financial advisors, and investors will benefit from a more adaptive and robust portfolio optimization tool. This could lead to better performance in various market conditions and reduced risk.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Model Complexity**: Integrating multiple factors and dynamic updates could make the model complex and difficult to interpret.
- **Data Requirements**: The model will require high-quality and extensive financial data, which could be challenging to obtain.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensuring the model complies with financial regulations and standards.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project is expected to have moderate costs, including:
- Access to comprehensive financial datasets.
- Potential collaboration with financial institutions or data providers.
- Computational resources for model training and testing.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- **Duration**: 6-12 months
- **Milestones**:
  - Months 1-3: Literature review and development of the Active Inference framework.
  - Months 4-6: Implementation and initial testing of the model.
  - Months 7-9: Validation with real-world data and comparison with existing portfolio optimization methods.
  - Months 10-12: Refinement and final testing.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: Successful implementation of the Active Inference model and initial validation with synthetic data.
- **Final Check Point**: Comprehensive validation with real-world financial data, comparison with existing methods, and feedback from financial professionals.

### Project Proposal 3: Ambitious, Longer-Term Project - Active Inference for Multi-Agent Financial Ecosystems

#### 1. What are you trying to do?
Develop an Active Inference framework for modeling and analyzing multi-agent financial ecosystems, where agents can share aspects of their generative models and take the perspective of other agents to achieve coordinated actions.

#### 2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Current approaches to modeling financial ecosystems often treat agents as isolated entities and do not fully capture the interactions and synergies between them. These models lack the ability to share knowledge and adapt dynamically.

#### 3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
This project will apply the concept of sympathetic intelligence within the Active Inference framework to create a multi-agent model where agents can share aspects of their generative models. This approach will enable agents to take the perspective of other agents, leading to more coordinated and adaptive actions in financial ecosystems.

#### 4. Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
Regulators, financial institutions, and market participants will benefit from a deeper understanding of how financial ecosystems function and interact. This could lead to more stable and resilient financial systems.

#### 5. What are the risks?
- **Complexity**: Modeling multi-agent interactions with shared generative models is highly complex.
- **Scalability**: Ensuring the model scales to large financial ecosystems.
- **Interpretability and Transparency**: Ensuring the model's outputs are interpretable and transparent for regulatory and practical purposes.

#### 6. How much will it cost?
This project is expected to have significant costs, including:
- Access to extensive and diverse financial datasets.
- Collaboration with multiple financial institutions and regulatory bodies.
- Advanced computational resources for model development and testing.

#### 7. How long will it take?
- **Duration**: 12-24 months
- **Milestones**:
  - Months 1-6: Literature review, development of the Active Inference framework for multi-agent systems, and initial modeling.
  - Months 7-12: Implementation and testing of the model with synthetic data.
  - Months 13-18: Validation with real-world data and collaboration with financial institutions.
  - Months 19-24: Refinement, final testing, and preparation for publication or implementation.

#### 8. What are the mid-term and final "check points" to see if you're on track?
- **Mid-term Check Point**: Successful implementation of the multi-agent Active Inference model and initial validation with synthetic data.
- **Final Check Point**: Comprehensive validation with real-world financial data, feedback from financial professionals and regulators, and preparation for publication or practical implementation.
