Here are the main research areas and his expertise:\n\n- **Music Therapy and Neuroscience**: He is actively involved in researching how music can be used to improve various aspects of health, particularly focusing on sleep behavior, dementia, and substance misuse. His work at the Cambridge Institute for Music Therapy Research (CIMTR) at Anglia Ruskin University is a testament to this[3][4].\n- **Music and Brain Physiology**: Muller-Rodriguez has a strong background in neuroscience, particularly in neuroimaging, as evidenced by his Master's degree in Neuroscience in Neuroimaging from King's College London. He uses techniques such as EEG measurements to study the effects of music on the brain[3][4].\n- **Digital Mental Health Interventions**: His involvement in projects like RadioMe, which develops adaptive radio systems for people with mild dementia, highlights his interest in digital mental health interventions[4].\n\n### Impact Analysis: Citation Patterns and Research Influence\n\n- **Citation Patterns**: While the provided data shows that some of his recent publications have not yet garnered significant citations (e.g., the 2024 publications have 0 citations), other works like \"RadioMe: Adaptive Radio to Support People with Mild Dementia in Their Own Home\" have been cited at least once, indicating some level of recognition within the field[2][4].\n- **Research Influence**: Although the citation count is relatively low for recent publications, his work is being presented at international conferences (e.g., Augmented Humans International Conference) and published in reputable journals (e.g., Addiction Science & Clinical Practice), which suggests a growing influence in the niche areas of music therapy and digital mental health interventions[4].\n\n### Research Evolution: How Their Research Interests Have Developed\n\nMuller-Rodriguez's research interests have evolved significantly over the years:\n\n- **Early Focus on Music Production**: He began his career with a focus on music production for media, earning a BA Hons in Music Production for Media from Ravensbourne University[3].\n- **Transition to Neuroscience**: He then shifted towards neuroscience, obtaining a Master's degree in Neuroscience in Neuroimaging from King's College London. This transition marked a significant shift towards understanding the neurological underpinnings of music's effects on the brain[3].\n- **Current Focus on Music Therapy**: As a PhD candidate at Anglia Ruskin University, his research now centers on music therapy, particularly how music can improve sleep behavior, manage anxiety, and support individuals with dementia[3][4].\n\n### Key Contributions: Notable Findings and Theoretical Contributions\n\n- **RadioMe Project**: Muller-Rodriguez has made significant contributions through the RadioMe project, which aims to improve the quality of life for dementia patients and their caregivers by developing an adaptive radio system that adjusts music based on the patient's heart rate[4].\n- **Neural Association Studies**: His work on the neural association between musical features and shared inter-subject emotional perception during movie-watching, using fMRI, contributes to the understanding of how music affects emotional processing in the brain[4].\n- **Music Therapy for Substance Misuse**: He is also involved in a feasibility study on music therapy for community substance misuse treatment services, which adds to the body of research on alternative therapies for addiction[4].\n\n### Future Directions: Potential Research Trajectories and Collaborations\n\n- **Integration of AI and Music Therapy**: Given his background in digital interventions and music therapy, future research could involve integrating AI algorithms to personalize music therapy further, enhancing its efficacy for various mental health conditions.\n- **Multi-Disciplinary Collaborations**: Muller-Rodriguez's work already involves collaborations across neuroscience, music therapy, and technology. Future collaborations could include working with clinicians, psychologists, and AI researchers to develop more comprehensive and effective music-based interventions.\n- **Expansion to Other Health Conditions**: While his current focus is on dementia, sleep behavior, and substance misuse, he could expand his research to other health conditions such as anxiety disorders, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), leveraging the therapeutic potential of music.\n- **Public Health Applications**: His research could also be scaled up for public health initiatives, developing accessible music-based interventions that can be integrated into community health programs.",
