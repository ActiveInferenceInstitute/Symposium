### Research Focus: Main Research Areas and Expertise

Jean-Francois Cloutier's research profile focuses on cognitive robotics and the software implementation of cognitive architectures. Here are the main areas of his research focus:

- **Cognition as collective intelligence**: His work focuses on producing emergent, apparently intelligent behaviors from interactions between many simple cognitive processes.
- **Symbolic machine learning**: He employs modern symbolic machine learning techniques, specifically Kant-influenced machine apperception, as opposed to artificial neural networks.
- **Mortal computing**: Cloutier's work explores, in the context of autonomous robots, how meaning is grounded in mortality.
- **Artificial agency**: His current focus is an exploration of agency whereby an autonomous robot acts for its own reasons and, in the process, makes sense of its umwelt via abstractions and affordances it discovers through active engagement.

### Impact Analysis: Citation Patterns and Research Influence

Jean-Francois Cloutier's research is self-published.

- **Recent Publications**:  [Toward a symbolic implementation of Active Inference for Lego robots](https://zenodo.org/records/6862636), [Finding causal theories quickly enough - building a responsive Apperception Engine](https://zenodo.org/records/10325868)

### Research Evolution: How Their Research Interests Have Developed

Cloutier's research interests have evolved over time, from the challenges of programming autonomous robots driven by a "society of mind"/predictive processing architecture, to adding a generative dimension (learning) with the ambition of realizing robotic agency.

### Future Directions: Potential Research Trajectories and Collaborations

Given Cloutier's current research trajectory, here are some potential future directions and collaborations:

- **Active inference analysis**: Applying the tools of active inference on observations of an artificial agent's behaviors and states to model the agent and validate that it survives by reducing surprisal.
- **Agency research platform**: Extending and instrumenting the artificial agent's implementation to support a wide-range of experimentation to characterize the conditions that favor survivable agency.
