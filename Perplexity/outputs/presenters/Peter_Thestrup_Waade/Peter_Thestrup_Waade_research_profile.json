  "content": "### Research Focus: Main Research Areas and Expertise\n\nPeter Thestrup Waade's research profile is predominantly centered around several key areas:\n\n- **Computational Cognitive Modeling**: He is specialized in computational cognitive modeling, particularly using tools like Julia for agent-based modeling, hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation, and predictive processing models such as the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter (HGF)[3][4][5].\n- **Active Inference and Predictive Brain Theory**: Waade's work often involves active inference, predictive brain theory, and embodied cognition. His research explores how these frameworks can be applied to various cognitive and social phenomena[3][4][5].\n- **Social Dynamics and Social Coordination**: He has a significant focus on social dynamics, including studies on social coordination, such as motion capture studies of partner dances like Lindy Hop[4][5].\n- **Neural Networks and Predictive Coding**: Waade is also involved in the development of neural network libraries for predictive coding, as seen in his work on the `pyhgf` library[4].\n- **Philosophy of Mind and Consciousness**: His research extends into philosophical questions about consciousness, interoceptive inference, and the integration of free energy principle and integrated information theory[4].\n\n### Impact Analysis: Citation Patterns and Research Influence\n\nThe citation patterns of Peter Thestrup Waade's publications indicate the following:\n\n- **Recent Publications**: His recent publications, such as \"What Might Interoceptive Inference Reveal about Consciousness?\" and \"Introducing tomsup: Theory of mind simulations using Python,\" have garnered a significant number of citations, with 19 and 7 citations respectively. This suggests that his work is being recognized and built upon within the field[4].\n- **Citation Distribution**: The citation counts vary, with earlier publications like \"What Might Interoceptive Inference Reveal about Consciousness?\" receiving more citations than newer ones like \"pyhgf: A neural network library for predictive coding,\" which has not yet been cited. This indicates that his earlier work is having a more immediate impact, while newer work is still in the process of being integrated into the broader academic discourse[4].\n- **Collaborations**: Waade's research often involves collaborations with other prominent researchers in the field, such as Karl Friston and Christoph Mathys, which further enhances the visibility and influence of his work[4].\n\n### Research Evolution: How Their Research Interests Have Developed\n\nPeter Thestrup Waade's research interests have evolved over time, reflecting a deepening and broadening of his expertise:\n\n- **Early Focus on Cognitive Science**: His initial research was grounded in cognitive science, with a focus on cognitive modeling and social dynamics during his master's and early PhD studies[5].\n- **Integration of Philosophical and Neuroscientific Perspectives**: Over time, his work has increasingly incorporated philosophical perspectives, particularly on consciousness and the predictive brain theory. This integration is evident in publications like \"What Might Interoceptive Inference Reveal about Consciousness?\"[4].\n- **Advanced Computational Methods**: There is a clear progression towards more advanced computational methods, including the development of specific libraries and tools for cognitive modeling and predictive coding, such as `ActionModels.jl` and `pyhgf`[3][4].\n- **Expansion into Social Coordination**: His recent work also shows an expansion into the study of social coordination, using motion capture and other experimental methods to understand social dynamics[4].\n\n### Key Contributions: Notable Findings and Theoretical Contributions\n\nPeter Thestrup Waade has made several notable contributions:\n\n- **Theory of Mind Simulations**: The introduction of `tomssup`, a Python package for theory of mind simulations, is a significant contribution to the field of cognitive modeling and social cognition[4].\n- **Predictive Brain Theory and Consciousness**: His work on interoceptive inference and its relation to consciousness, particularly in the context of the free energy principle and integrated information theory, has provided new insights into the nature of conscious experience[4].\n- **Hierarchical Gaussian Filtering**: The development and application of the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter (HGF) in various cognitive modeling contexts is another key contribution, enhancing the toolkit for predictive processing models[3][4].\n- **Social Coordination Studies**: His studies on social coordination, such as the motion capture analysis of Lindy Hop partner dance, have shed light on the dynamics of social interaction and synchronization[4].\n\n### Future Directions: Potential Research Trajectories and Collaborations\n\nGiven his current research profile, potential future directions for Peter Thestrup Waade include:\n\n- **Further Integration of Predictive Coding and Social Dynamics**: Continuing to explore how predictive coding models can be applied to understand complex social behaviors and interactions.\n- **Advanced Computational Tools**: Developing more sophisticated computational tools and libraries for cognitive modeling, potentially integrating machine learning and Bayesian inference techniques.\n- **Interdisciplinary Collaborations**: Collaborating with researchers from philosophy, neuroscience, and social sciences to further explore the intersection of predictive brain theory, consciousness, and social dynamics.\n- **Experimental and Empirical Studies**: Conducting more extensive experimental studies using motion capture and other methods to validate theoretical models of social coordination and cognitive processes.\n- **Expansion into Clinical Applications**: Exploring how his research on predictive brain theory and cognitive modeling can be applied to clinical settings, such as in the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric disorders[3][4][5].",
