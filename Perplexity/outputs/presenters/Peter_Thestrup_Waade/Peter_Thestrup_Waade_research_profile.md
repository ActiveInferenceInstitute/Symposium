### Research Focus: Main Research Areas and Expertise

Peter Thestrup Waade's research profile is predominantly centered around several key areas:

- **Computational Cognitive Modeling**: He is specialized in computational cognitive modeling, particularly using tools like Julia for agent-based modeling, hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation, and predictive processing models such as the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter (HGF)[3][4][5].
- **Active Inference and Predictive Brain Theory**: Waade's work often involves active inference, predictive brain theory, and embodied cognition. His research explores how these frameworks can be applied to various cognitive and social phenomena[3][4][5].
- **Social Dynamics and Social Coordination**: He has a significant focus on social dynamics, including studies on social coordination, such as motion capture studies of partner dances like Lindy Hop[4][5].
- **Neural Networks and Predictive Coding**: Waade is also involved in the development of neural network libraries for predictive coding, as seen in his work on the `pyhgf` library[4].
- **Philosophy of Mind and Consciousness**: His research extends into philosophical questions about consciousness, interoceptive inference, and the integration of free energy principle and integrated information theory[4].

### Impact Analysis: Citation Patterns and Research Influence

The citation patterns of Peter Thestrup Waade's publications indicate the following:

- **Recent Publications**: His recent publications, such as "What Might Interoceptive Inference Reveal about Consciousness?" and "Introducing tomsup: Theory of mind simulations using Python," have garnered a significant number of citations, with 19 and 7 citations respectively. This suggests that his work is being recognized and built upon within the field[4].
- **Citation Distribution**: The citation counts vary, with earlier publications like "What Might Interoceptive Inference Reveal about Consciousness?" receiving more citations than newer ones like "pyhgf: A neural network library for predictive coding," which has not yet been cited. This indicates that his earlier work is having a more immediate impact, while newer work is still in the process of being integrated into the broader academic discourse[4].
- **Collaborations**: Waade's research often involves collaborations with other prominent researchers in the field, such as Karl Friston and Christoph Mathys, which further enhances the visibility and influence of his work[4].

### Research Evolution: How Their Research Interests Have Developed
