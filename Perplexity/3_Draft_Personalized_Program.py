{profile_content}

Please create a detailed, structured learning plan that includes:

1. IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (1-2 weeks):
   - Specific resources to start with
   - Initial learning objectives
   - Concrete actions to take

2. SHORT-TERM GOALS (1-3 months):
   - Key concepts to master
   - Practical exercises or projects
   - Recommended study materials
   - Community engagement opportunities

3. MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT (3-6 months):
   - Advanced topics to explore
   - Potential collaboration opportunities
   - Application projects in their domain
   - Skill-building activities

4. SPECIFIC RESOURCES:
   - Active Inference materials, from Active Inference Institute and others
   - Relevant Academic papers and tutorials
   - Software tools and frameworks
   - Community resources and events
   - Domain-specific applications

5. PROGRESS TRACKING:
   - Milestones and checkpoints
   - Self-assessment methods
   - Practical application opportunities

Focus on making the plan:
- Highly specific to their background and interests
- Actionable with concrete next steps
- Realistic given their current level
- Aligned with their stated learning needs
- Connected to their domain of application

Include links to specific resources where possible."""
