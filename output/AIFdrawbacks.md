## Why Active Inference Is Not Used Massively

1. Mathematical Complexity

The framework involves complex mathematical concepts like variational Bayes and free energy minimization
Many practitioners find it more challenging to implement than traditional approaches like reinforcement learning
The learning curves for both theoretical understanding and practical implementation are quite steep

2. Computational Demands

Active inference models often require significant computational resources
The optimization process can be more intensive than alternative approaches
Real-time applications can be challenging due to performance requirements

3. Limited Tooling

Compared to frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow for deep learning, there are fewer ready-to-use tools
Existing implementations often focus on theoretical demonstrations rather than practical applications
The lack of production-ready libraries makes adoption harder

4. Alternative Methods Work Well

Established methods like deep reinforcement learning have proven effective for many applications
The incremental benefits of active inference may not justify the additional complexity
Industry tends to favor simpler, well-understood approaches

5. Research-Practice Gap

Most work on active inference remains in academic/theoretical settings
There aren't many clear examples of active inference outperforming existing methods on practical problems
The field needs more "killer applications" to drive adoption
