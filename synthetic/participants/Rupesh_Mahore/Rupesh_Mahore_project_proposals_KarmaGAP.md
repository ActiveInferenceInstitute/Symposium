### 2. Problem Statement

**What is the root cause of the issue the project addresses?**

The current challenge in wound healing lies in the complexity and dynamic nature of wound environments. Healing is a multifaceted process involving numerous cell types, signaling pathways, and biochemical factors that change over time. Passive dressings lack the ability to adapt to these dynamic changes and provide targeted interventions, often leading to suboptimal outcomes.

* **Systemic Challenges:** The current healthcare system often relies on a "one-size-fits-all" approach for wound care, neglecting the unique needs of individual patients and their specific wound types.
* **Structural Challenges:** Existing wound care products often lack the sophisticated sensing and actuation capabilities needed to provide precise and targeted therapies within the dynamic wound environment.
* **Behavioral Challenges:** Limited patient adherence to complex wound care regimens and the difficulty of monitoring wound progress remotely contribute to the current challenge.

**What evidence supports the importance of addressing this issue?**

* **Reliable Data:** Numerous studies highlight the increasing prevalence and high cost of chronic wounds.  The World Health Organization reports that chronic wounds affect up to 2% of the population in developed countries, placing a significant burden on healthcare resources.
* **Case Studies:** Clinical cases demonstrate the limitations of current wound care approaches, particularly for complex wounds that require meticulous management and personalized interventions.
* **Risks of Inaction:** Failing to address this challenge will result in increasingly strained healthcare systems, prolonged patient suffering, and increased risk of complications like infections and amputations.
