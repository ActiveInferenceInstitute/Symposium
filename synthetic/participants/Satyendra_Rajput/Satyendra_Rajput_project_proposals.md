## Project Title:  **CROWDBOTS:  Crowding-Driven, Bio-Hybrid Soft Robots for Autonomous Wound Healing**

### 1. Project Rationale and Objectives

**1.1. Societal Problem and Relevance:**

Chronic wounds represent a significant and growing societal burden, affecting millions of individuals across the EU and globally. These wounds, often associated with diabetes, vascular disease, and aging populations, lead to prolonged suffering, reduced quality of life, and significant healthcare costs.  Traditional treatments for chronic wounds are often ineffective, and the development of new therapeutic approaches that promote rapid and efficient healing is critically needed. 

This project is highly relevant now due to:

* **Increasing prevalence of chronic wounds:** As the EU population ages and the incidence of diabetes and other chronic diseases rises, the burden of chronic wounds continues to escalate, demanding novel and effective solutions.
* **Limitations of current treatments:**  Existing therapies often rely on passive dressings or systemic medications, lacking precise targeting and control over the healing process. 
* **Emerging potential of bio-hybrid materials:** Advances in soft matter science, microfluidics, and synthetic biology enable creating bio-hybrid materials that combine synthetic elements with biological components, paving the way for more intelligent and adaptive treatment approaches.


**1.2. Alignment with EU Call Objectives:**

This project aligns perfectly with the anticipated Horizon Europe call "**Novel Biomaterials and Systems for Personalised Therapy**", aiming to develop innovative therapeutic strategies based on advanced materials and engineering principles. The call specifically seeks projects that:

*  Develop novel bio-inspired materials with enhanced functionality and bioactivity.
*  Integrate biological components within synthetic systems for personalized therapeutic interventions.
*  Showcase the potential for translational research with clear clinical and societal benefits.

**1.3. Vision:**

The CROWDBOTS project envisions a paradigm shift in chronic wound treatment by developing  autonomous, bio-hybrid soft robots that actively promote tissue regeneration and accelerate healing.  This vision will be realized by leveraging Satyendra Rajput's expertise on molecular crowding to create bio-inspired soft robots that integrate living cells within a stimuli-responsive polymer matrix. 

**1.4. Measurable Impacts:**

* **Growth factor therapies:** While promising, they face challenges related to delivery, stability, and cost-effectiveness.

**2.2. Gaps and Challenges**:

Existing methods fail to:

* **Actively promote tissue regeneration**  at the wound site.
* **Deliver therapeutic agents precisely** and on-demand.
* **Adapt to the dynamic microenvironment** of a healing wound.

**2.3. Advancing Beyond Current Approaches**:

This project proposes a paradigm shift by:
* **Developing autonomous, bio-hybrid soft robots** that act as  mobile "therapeutic factories" within the wound microenvironment. 
* **Leveraging molecular crowding**  to control cellular behavior and promote tissue regeneration – a novel approach not yet explored in the context of wound healing. 
* **Integrating sensing and actuation capabilities**  within the robot to enable autonomous movement and targeted drug delivery.



**2.4. Unique Selling Points (USPs):**

* **First-of-its-kind autonomous therapy** for chronic wounds.
* **Novel integration of molecular crowding**  principles with soft robotics (**Research Domain Field Shift:** Applying the knowledge of dynamic cell behavior from the field of molecular crowding  to a different field  - intelligent soft matter and control of micro-robots).
