Project Rationale and Objectives\n\n**1.1 Societal, Scientific, and Technological Problem:**\n\nChronic wounds represent a significant and growing healthcare burden worldwide, affecting millions of people and placing a strain on healthcare systems.  These wounds, often associated with diabetes, pressure ulcers, and burns, are characterized by their delayed healing process, leading to prolonged suffering, increased risk of infections, and significant economic costs.  Current wound management strategies often fall short in addressing the complex and dynamic nature of chronic wound healing, calling for innovative approaches that can adapt to the changing wound environment and accelerate tissue regeneration. \n\n**1.2 Relevance Now:**\n\nThe urgency for innovative wound healing solutions is underscored by: \n\n* **Aging population:**  With increasing life expectancy, the incidence of chronic wounds is projected to rise dramatically, placing increasing demands on healthcare resources.\n* **Antibiotic resistance:** Chronic wounds are highly susceptible to infections, and the rise of antibiotic resistance poses a major threat to effective wound management.\n* **Need for personalized medicine:** Current wound care lacks individual adaptability.  Intelligent soft matter offers a new paradigm for personalized wound management by creating materials that can respond to individual patient needs.\n\n**1.3 Alignment with EU Call Objectives:**\n\nThis project directly aligns with the EU's Horizon Europe program, specifically within Cluster 1: Health, and Challenge 1: Staying healthy in a rapidly changing society.
