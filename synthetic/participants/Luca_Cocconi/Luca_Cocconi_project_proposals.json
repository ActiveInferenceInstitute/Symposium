Vision and Scope\n\n**What is the project’s overarching goal?**\n\nThe overarching goal of this project is to **engineer active colloidal matter capable of exhibiting emergent cognitive functions within a microfluidic environment**. Specifically, we aim to create a system of self-propelled colloidal particles that can autonomously **sense, learn, adapt, and make decisions** based on their interactions with the dynamically changing microfluidic environment. This emergent “material intelligence” will be harnessed to **control microfluidic processes, optimize fluid flow, perform complex tasks (e.g., sorting, mixing, separation), and ultimately demonstrate the potential for computation within soft matter.**\n\n- **Change or impact**: This project aims to establish a new paradigm of “material intelligence” that transcends traditional material design principles and moves toward a future where materials possess cognitive-like abilities. This has the potential to revolutionize various fields, including soft robotics, microfluidics, biomedical devices, and ultimately contribute to a deeper understanding of cognition itself.\n- **Societal/Scientific challenges**: The project addresses several key challenges: (1) **Creating materials that can autonomously perform complex tasks**, (2) **Developing new computational paradigms based on the physics of soft matter**, (3) **Bridging the gap between living and non-living systems by emulating cognitive functions in synthetic materials.** \n- **Distinguishing features:** This initiative distinguishes itself from other similar projects by focusing on the **integration of active inference frameworks with the physics of active colloidal matter**. While active colloidal matter research typically focuses on collective behavior and emergent patterns, this project explicitly aims to embed decision-making and learning capabilities based on a theoretical framework from cognitive science.\n\n**Why is the project needed now?** \n\nThe field of intelligent soft matter is rapidly evolving, yet there remains a gap in understanding how to create materials that can autonomously learn and  make decisions. This project is timely because:\n\n- **Convergence of research fields:** Recent advancements in microfluidics, active matter research, machine learning, and cognitive science create a unique opportunity to integrate diverse perspectives and push the boundaries of the field.\n- **Demand for autonomous systems:** There is a growing need for intelligent, autonomous systems capable of adapting to complex and dynamic environments. The ability to create such systems at the microscale will open new avenues in areas like biomedical engineering, environmental monitoring, and soft robotics.\n- **Exploration of new computing paradigms:** The project aligns with the growing interest in alternative computing models like neuromorphic computing.  This project will explore the potential for physical computation using the dynamics of active matter materials. \n\n\n### 2. Problem Statement\n\n**What is the root cause of the issue the project addresses?**\n\nThe current limitation in developing intelligent soft matter lies in the lack of a unifying framework that connects material properties with cognitive functions. The root cause of this issue is multifaceted:\n\n- **Systemic:**  Traditional materials science approaches do not readily incorporate concepts of perception, learning, and decision-making.\n- **Structural:**  Current fabrication approaches often lack the precision and complexity needed to create  materials with the hierarchical organization and multi-scale functionalities that underpin intelligent behavior.\n- **Behavioral:**  We lack a deep understanding of how to design feedback loops and adaptive mechanisms that enable soft matter to learn from its interactions with the environment. \n\n**What evidence supports the importance of addressing this issue?**\n\n* **Limited adaptability in existing materials**: Current soft materials are mainly limited to predefined functionalities and lack the ability to autonomously respond to unforeseen environmental changes. \n* **Growing demand for autonomy:** Fields like robotics and biomedical engineering require increasingly adaptive and intelligent materials, which necessitates bridging this gap in knowledge.\n* **Potential for novel computing paradigms:** Developing materials capable of computation based on their physical properties has the potential to revolutionize computing technologies, particularly for low-energy applications and in situ data processing. \n\n\n### 3. Proposed Solution and Key Innovation:\n\n**What is the central idea or mechanism behind the project’s solution?**\n\nThe central idea of the project is to create **active colloidal matter integrated within a microfluidic environment** that functions as a distributed cognitive system. This will be achieved by:\n\n* **Active Colloidal Matter:**  Synthesizing colloidal particles capable of self-propulsion, potentially using catalytic reactions or light activation. (**Daniela Kraft & Martin Hanczyc**)\n* **Microfluidic Networks:**  Designing microfluidic channels and chambers that incorporate specific features to manipulate the flow and behavior of the particles. (**Cecile Cottin-Bizonne**)\n* **Embedded Communication & Sensing:**  Functionalizing particles with specific ligands or molecules to enable communication and sensing of environmental cues (e.g., chemical gradients, obstacles, flow patterns). (**Daniela Kraft**)\n* **Active Inference Framework:** Incorporating the principles of active inference, a theoretical framework from cognitive science that describes how agents learn and adapt based on minimizing prediction errors.  This will involve developing computational models that translate the particle interactions into internal states, allowing particles to learn from their environment, make predictions, and optimize their behavior within the microfluidic network (**Luca Cocconi & Dmitry Fedosov**).\n* **Multiscale Modeling and Simulation:**  Developing multiscale models that bridge the microscopic behavior of the active particles with the macroscopic fluid dynamics within the microfluidic environment. This model will be critical to understand the emergent cognitive behaviors arising from the collective dynamics of the particles (**Dmitry Fedosov**).\n* **Soft Actuators & Response:** Integrating stimuli-responsive soft actuators within the microfluidic environment to create active boundaries or controllable patterns. This will allow for dynamic control of the fluid flow based on the decisions made by the active matter system (**Aniket Pal**).\n\n**Key Innovation:**\n\nThe groundbreaking aspect of this project is the **combination of active matter physics with the framework of active inference**. This approach bridges the gap between materials science and cognitive science by embedding a theoretical framework for decision-making and learning directly into the material's dynamic behavior. Traditional approaches in microfluidic design rely on external control systems, while this project aims to create a **system with intrinsic intelligence, where the material itself can adapt and optimize its behavior.**\n\n**How does the solution improve upon or differ from existing approaches?** \n\nThis project introduces a **paradigm shift in microfluidic design** that moves beyond predetermined functionalities and external control systems. Existing approaches to microfluidics typically rely on complex networks of channels and pumps controlled by external computers. This approach is:\n\n* **Transformative:** By creating materials with inherent cognitive abilities, the project opens up new possibilities for designing systems with unprecedented autonomy and adaptability at the microscale.\n* **Paradigm-shifting:** The successful application of active inference within a physical system will demonstrate a new way of thinking about materials and their potential for computation and control. The integration of a cognitive framework into the material's behavior moves beyond the traditional approach of  designing materials with predefined, passive behaviors. \n\n\n### 4.
