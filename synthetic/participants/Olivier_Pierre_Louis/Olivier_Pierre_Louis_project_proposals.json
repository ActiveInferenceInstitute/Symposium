What KPIs and evaluation frameworks will be used to measure project success?** \n\n* KPIs:  \n   - Reduction of bacterial viability on developed surfaces (minimum 99.9% reduction)\n   - Number of adaptable functionalities demonstrably engineered into the surfaces (target: 3).\n   - Predictive accuracy of the developed computational model (target: >90%).\n* Evaluation frameworks: \n     - Regular review of progress against the proposed work plan milestones and deliverables. \n     - Assessment of scientific output (publications) and intellectual property generation.\n     -  External reviewers providing independent feedback at key stages of the project, aligning with EU standards.\n\n**13.2.  How will progress be assessed against EU-defined objectives and priorities?**\n\nProgress will be assessed through periodic reports submitted to the EU funding agency, including: \n\n* **Scientific Reports:**  Detailing progress in achieving the scientific objectives. \n* **Financial Reports:**  Accounting for budget utilization and ensuring cost-efficiency.\n* **Impact Reports:**  Highlighting the project's contributions towards EU policies (e.g., European Health Union, Green Deal) and societal challenges. \n\n **13.3.  What mechanisms will ensure continuous improvement and adaptation throughout the project life cycle?**\n\n*   **Regular Consortium Meetings:** To discuss progress, identify challenges, and adapt strategies. \n*   **External Feedback:**  Incorporating feedback from external stakeholders, particularly from potential technology users.\n\n**13.4. How will you incorporate stakeholder feedback into evaluations?**\n\n* **Stakeholder Workshops:** A mid-project workshop will be held to gather feedback from a range of stakeholders, including clinicians, industry representatives, and patient groups. \n* **Online Feedback Mechanisms:** The project website will provide a channel for stakeholders to provide ongoing feedback and suggestions.\n\n**13.5. What are the success criteria for determining when to scale, pivot, or terminate the project?**\n\n* **Scalability:** If the pilot studies demonstrate successful feasibility and the market analysis indicates high adoption potential, the consortium will pursue scaling the production towards commercial viability, particularly if strong interest is demonstrated by potential industry partners.\n* **Pivot:** If unforeseen challenges or more promising avenues emerge during research, the project may pivot its direction while staying within the framework of intelligent soft matter and antimicrobial applications.\n* **Termination:** The project may be terminated if it becomes evident that the chosen approaches are not feasible or if the key objectives outlined in the proposal are unattainable, despite efforts to adapt. This decision would be made only after extensive analysis and consultation with the EU funding agency, ensuring transparency throughout the process. \n\n\n## 14.
