**Shifted Domain:**  Creating a bio-inspired soft matter "brain" for environmental remediation, capable of sensing, information processing, and adapting its behaviour.

**Chosen Collaborators:**

1. **Ramin Golestanian**: His expertise in active matter and theoretical modeling will be crucial in establishing the theoretical framework for the "brain" function. He will guide the development of computational models based on neural networks and active inference principles to translate environmental sensing into appropriate remediation actions.
2. **Wolfgang Parak**:  His expertise in nanoparticle fabrication and surface modification will be central to the development of sensitive and responsive elements embedded within the soft matter matrix. He will focus on designing nanoparticles capable of selectively binding to and removing/neutralizing specific pollutants.  
3. **Se-Hyeong Jung**:  His mastery over stimuli-responsive polymers and hydrogels will provide the physical architecture and dynamic properties for the responsive material. He will focus on designing polymers that react to the presence of pollutants by either changing their properties (e.g. encapsulating the pollutant) or enabling the release of nanoparticles designed by Wolfgang Parak for targeted remediation.

**Rationale for Collaboration:**

This specific combination of collaborators provides a unique mix of skills:

* **Golestanian:** The "brain" -  Theoretical modelling and conceptual framework for intelligent behavior.
* **Parak**: The "senses" -  Nanoparticles as sensitive elements to detect and interact with pollutants.
* **Jung:**  The "body"  - Adaptive polymers and hydrogels that respond and actuate based on information.

This integrated approach is essential for the project's success and is a powerful example of the research field shift technique that allows for combining expertise from different domains and creating a novel and high impact research project addressing crucial challenges in the field.
