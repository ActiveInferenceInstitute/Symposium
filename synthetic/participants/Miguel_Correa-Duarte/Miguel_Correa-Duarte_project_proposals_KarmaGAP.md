## 2. Problem Statement

**What is the root cause of the issue the project addresses?**

The current wound healing process is often inefficient, leading to prolonged healing times, increased risk of infection, and unsatisfactory aesthetic outcomes. These challenges stem from several root causes, including:

- **Systemic:**  Underlying health conditions like diabetes or compromised immune systems can hinder the natural healing cascade.
- **Structural:** The complex architecture of the skin and underlying tissues requires a coordinated approach for successful regeneration.
- **Behavioral:**  Patient non-compliance with wound care instructions and external factors like infection can disrupt wound healing.

**What evidence supports the importance of addressing this issue?**

The urgency of addressing this issue is underscored by the following evidence:

- **Prevalence of Chronic Wounds:**  Millions of people worldwide suffer from chronic wounds, leading to significant healthcare costs and reduced quality of life. Studies show a global prevalence of chronic wounds ranging from 0.18% to 1.3% of the population.
- **Rising Healthcare Costs:**  Chronic wound care is a significant burden on healthcare systems worldwide. The global market for advanced wound care products is projected to reach \$22 billion by 2027, indicating the substantial economic impact of wound management.
- **Risks of Inaction:**  Untreated chronic wounds can lead to severe complications such as amputations, sepsis, and even death. The risks associated with inaction warrant the development of novel therapies for effective wound treatment.

## 3. Proposed Solution and Key Innovation

**What is the central idea or mechanism behind the project’s solution?**

The project proposes a plasmon-activated, bio-inspired system that mimics the natural healing cascade:

1. **Bio-inspired Scaffold:** A biocompatible hydrogel matrix, simulating the extracellular matrix, serves as a foundation for cell growth and tissue regeneration. Miguel Correa-Duarte's existing expertise in biocompatible material design, particularly 3D carbon nanotube networks, will be essential for this stage.
2. **Plasmonic Activation:**  Incorporating plasmonic nanoparticles (e.g., gold nanostars) within the hydrogel matrix. These nanoparticles absorb specific wavelengths of light, generating localized heat. This heat triggers the release of growth factors and other therapeutic agents from the hydrogel at precise locations in response to external light stimuli, guided by pre-programmed patterns encoded within the material.
3. **Autonomous Feedback:**  Integrating nanoscale sensors within the hydrogel (a key area of expertise for Wolfgang Parak) that detect biological signals indicative of healing progress. The sensor output dynamically modulates the plasmonic activation pattern, ensuring an adaptive response throughout the entire healing process. 


**How does the solution improve upon existing approaches?**

This solution offers a transformative paradigm shift in wound care:

* **Autonomous Adaptation:** Existing wound healing products lack autonomous adaptation, requiring frequent dressing changes and interventions. The proposed platform uses real-time feedback to optimize healing based on individual needs.
* **Spatiotemporal Control:** Conventional therapies lack precise control over drug delivery or tissue regeneration. This platform provides targeted stimulation of specific cell populations and tissues at designated times, mimicking the natural healing cascade.
* **Minimally Invasive:**  Traditional wound treatments are often invasive, requiring debridement or surgical intervention. This approach offers a minimally invasive solution, enhancing patient comfort and recovery.
