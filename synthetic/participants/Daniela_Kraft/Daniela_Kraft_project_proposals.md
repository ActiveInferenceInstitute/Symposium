*  **Equal Opportunity Recruitment:**  During the recruitment process, qualifications and experience will be prioritized. The consortium will ensure that application procedures are fair and accessible to all potential candidates, regardless of their gender.
*  **Supportive Working Environment:**  The consortium will create a supportive working environment that promotes gender equality and inclusivity, free from any form of discrimination or harassment.
* **Mentoring and Training:**  The project will provide mentoring and training opportunities for all researchers, with a specific focus on empowering female researchers and those from underrepresented groups to develop their leadership skills. 

**15.2 Inclusivity and Diversity:**

*  **Diverse Consortium:** The participating research groups have existing policies promoting diversity and inclusivity.  The project will build upon these by embracing the diverse perspectives of its members, regardless of gender, background, or origin. 
*  **Accessibility in Dissemination:**  Research outputs, including publications, presentations, and the project website, will be made accessible to a wider audience, including those with disabilities.


## Conclusion:
