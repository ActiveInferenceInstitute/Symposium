Vision and Scope  \n\n**What is the project’s overarching goal?** \n\nThe project’s overarching goal is to develop a new paradigm of computation by creating a bio-inspired soft matter computing platform that functions analogously to a biological neural network. This platform will leverage the self-organizing and adaptive properties of active matter, specifically catalytic Janus particles developed by Stephen Ebbens, to perform distributed computation, mimicking the decentralized information processing in the brain. This will pave the way for creating highly energy-efficient, adaptable, and robust computational systems with applications ranging from soft robotics to environmental monitoring.\n\n- **Change/Impact:** The project aims to revolutionize computation by  transcending the limitations of traditional silicon-based computing,  leading to a new generation of adaptable, low-power, and bio-compatible computing systems. This can have a transformative impact on various industries, from healthcare and environmental engineering to robotics and artificial intelligence.\n- **Societal/Scientific Challenges:** The project addresses the increasing demand for more efficient and adaptable computing systems, particularly for applications in artificial intelligence, robotics, and bio-integrated devices. The current silicon-based paradigm struggles to keep up with the demands of big data and complex machine learning algorithms, facing limitations in energy consumption and scalability. This project offers a potential solution by taking inspiration from the highly efficient and adaptable information processing capabilities of biological systems. \n- **Distinction:** This initiative distinguishes itself from other projects by focusing on physically embodied computation within soft matter. Unlike traditional artificial neural networks implemented on silicon chips, this project aims to create a physically adaptive network where information is processed through the dynamics and interactions of active particles, offering inherent advantages in adaptability, robustness, and potential for bio-integration.\n\n\n\n**Why is the project needed now?** \n\nThe project is needed now because the demand for more efficient and scalable computational solutions is rapidly increasing, while limitations of the conventional paradigm become increasingly apparent: \n\n- **Pressing Issue:** Current computational technologies struggle to cope  with the exponential growth of data and the complexity of algorithms for modern artificial intelligence applications. They are energy-intensive and lack the inherent adaptability and fault-tolerance of biological systems. \n- **Alignment with Trends:** There's a growing recognition  that new approaches to computation, inspired by biological systems, are needed. The convergence of soft matter research, active matter, and machine learning has created a unique opportunity to explore radically different computing paradigms,  with this project aiming to be at the forefront of these efforts.\n\n\n\n### 2. Problem Statement\n\n**What is the root cause of the issue the project addresses?**\n\nThe root cause is the limitations of the current digital computing paradigm, which relies on centralized processing units and binary logic. This approach struggles to replicate the efficiency, adaptability, and robustness of biological neural networks, which are inherently decentralized, analog, and physically embodied. These challenges are manifested as:\n\n- **Systemic Challenges:** High energy consumption, heat generation, and the need for complex, energy-intensive cooling systems for large-scale data processing.\n- **Structural Challenges:**  Limitations in scalability, susceptibility to errors and failures, and inherent difficulty in interfacing with biological systems due to the rigid nature of traditional electronics.\n- **Behavioral Challenges:** Difficulty in adapting to novel or unforeseen inputs, inflexible programming, and challenges in replicating the emergent cognitive abilities of biological systems like learning, adaptation, and self-organization.\n\n\n**What evidence supports the importance of addressing this issue?**\n\n- **Data/Case Studies:** The growing energy demands of data centers and the limitations of Moore's Law highlight the need for new computational paradigms.   Studies on the efficiency of biological neural networks demonstrate the potential of alternative models.\n- **Historical Trends:** The shift towards distributed computing and  the increasing need for bio-integrated devices call for  more flexible and adaptable computational platforms.\n- **Risks of Inaction:**  Failure to address these limitations will hamper progress in AI, robotics, and other fields that rely on advanced computation, resulting in energy inefficiency, technological bottlenecks, and a decreased ability to address societal challenges.\n\n\n\n\n### 3.
