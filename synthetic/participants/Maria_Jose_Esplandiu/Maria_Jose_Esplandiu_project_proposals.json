Alignment with EU Inclusivity Goals\n\nThe project will fully align with the EU's broader inclusivity goals by actively promoting equal access and opportunity for women in STEM throughout the project lifecycle. \n\n##  **Selected Collaborators and Project Design**\n\n###  **Research Domain Field Shift: From Biofilms to Bio-Hybrid Soft Matter**\n\nThis project will utilize a \"Research Domain Field Shift\" strategy, drawing inspiration from the collective behavior, sensing, and adaptation strategies observed in bacterial biofilms.  These concepts will be translated into the design of bio-hybrid materials capable of autonomous environmental remediation. While biofilms are often considered harmful in medical and industrial settings, their inherent properties and behaviors can be harnessed and repurposed for beneficial applications, leading to a shifted domain with novel solutions for environmental challenges.\n\n### **Key Collaborators:**\n\n**1. Maria Jose Esplandiu (Lead Researcher, Material Design and Synthesis – WP Leader WP1):** Her expertise in carbon nanotubes, self-assembled monolayers, and electrochemical sensing provides a solid foundation for building the material platform for the bio-hybrid soft matter structure.\n\n**2. Ajesh Jose (Collaborator, Bio-Component Engineering and Integration):**  His research in bacterial swarm behavior and biofilms provides valuable insights for designing bio-inspired sensing, communication, and collective behavior within the intelligent soft materials.  He will be primarily involved in WP2. \n\n**3.  Dmitry Fedosov (Collaborator,  Computational Modelling and Control):** His expertise in multiscale modeling, particularly in the context of complex fluids and active matter, will be crucial for developing the computational models and algorithms that guide the material's behavior, contributing directly to the success of WP4.\n\nAdditional collaborators will be selected and integrated based on the specific targets and needs for WP3 (Microfluidic Fabrication and 3D Printing) and WP5 (Testing, Validation, and dissemination). \n\n### **Detailed Project Concept**:\n\nInspired by how bacterial biofilms sense, adapt to, and degrade organic matter, the project will focus on developing bio-hybrid soft materials that perform analogously to remediate environmental pollutants.  \n\n**Core Design Principles (Concept Translation):**\n\n* **Sensing**:   \n    * Mimicking quorum sensing found in biofilms, the materials will incorporate biosensors specifically engineered to detect specific target pollutants. In this approach, the concentration of pollutants will act as the signal that triggers the aggregation of the material towards the source, similar to how bacteria aggregate in response to quorum sensing molecules. \n* **Communication**:  \n    * Inspired by the communication pathways within biofilms, the engineered materials will utilize local chemical signaling to coordinate their movement and degradation activities, enabling a decentralized control strategy that resembles biofilm expansion and organization.  \n* **Degradation**:  \n    * Borrowing from the enzyme-mediated degradation strategies in biofilms, the materials will incorporate immobilized enzymes specifically targeted to degrade the detected pollutants. The enzymes will be selected and optimized to efficiently break down the pollutants into harmless byproducts.\n\n**Material Design and Fabrication:**\n\n* **Building Blocks:**  Maria Jose Esplandiu’s expertise in carbon nanotubes will be utilized to create a porous, biocompatible scaffold structure.  The high surface area of this scaffold will be ideal for immobilizing enzymes and sensors efficiently, mimicking the matrix structure of biofilms.\n* **Stimuli-Responsive Polymers:**  Stimuli-responsive polymers (e.g., hydrogels with environmental responsiveness like pH) will be incorporated into the scaffold to enable dynamic changes in shape, permeability, and rigidity in response to local pollutant concentration, facilitating movement, aggregation, and optimized degradation. These will act analogously to the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that provide structure and adaptability to biofilms.\n* **Bio-Component Integration:**  Ajesh Jose will contribute to the engineering and integration of biosensors and specific degradation enzymes, drawing on his understanding of bacterial systems. He will guide the design of customized biosensors that detect the target pollutant, using approaches such as DNAzyme-based sensors for a specific heavy metal or a genetically modified bacterial system for sensing specific xenobiotics. The enzymes would be chosen or engineered to efficiently"
