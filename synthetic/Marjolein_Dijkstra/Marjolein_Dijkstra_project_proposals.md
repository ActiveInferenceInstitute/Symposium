## Project Title:  Cognizant Metamaterials:  Programming Material Cognition Through Topological Defects in Active Liquid Crystals 

### 1. Project Rationale and Objectives

**1.1 Societal, Scientific, or Technological Problem:** The project tackles the grand challenge of creating truly intelligent materials that can sense, process information, and adapt their behaviour autonomously, mimicking cognitive functions found in biological systems. Current approaches to intelligent materials often rely on external computation and control, limiting their autonomy and scalability. This project aims to overcome this limitation by embedding computation directly within the material structure itself, leading to a paradigm shift in material design and applications.  

**1.2 Alignment with EU Call for Proposals**: This project aligns perfectly with the Horizon Europe call "Future Emerging Technologies" (FET), specifically targeting the area of "Cognizant Matter". The project's innovative approach to material intelligence directly responds to this call by seeking to  create materials that process information and make decisions autonomously.

**1.3 Vision and Measurable Impacts:** The project envisions creating a new class of materials called "cognizant metamaterials" that possess embedded cognitive functionalities.  The measurable impact will be demonstrated through:

*  **Proof-of-concept prototypes**:  Fabricating microfluidic devices incorporating active liquid crystal metamaterials with embedded memory and rudimentary learning capabilities. 
*  **Novel theoretical framework:**  Developing a theoretical framework linking topological defects in active liquid crystals to  information processing and memory functionalities.
* **Dissemination of results:** Publishing high-impact scientific publications in top-tier journals like *Nature* or *Science* and presenting the results at international conferences.
