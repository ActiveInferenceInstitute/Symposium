Project Rationale and Objectives\n\n**1.1 Societal, Scientific, or Technological Problem:** The project tackles the grand challenge of creating truly intelligent materials that can sense, process information, and adapt their behaviour autonomously, mimicking cognitive functions found in biological systems. Current approaches to intelligent materials often rely on external computation and control, limiting their autonomy and scalability. This project aims to overcome this limitation by embedding computation directly within the material structure itself, leading to a paradigm shift in material design and applications.  \n\n**1.2 Alignment with EU Call for Proposals**: This project aligns perfectly with the Horizon Europe call \"Future Emerging Technologies\" (FET), specifically targeting the area of \"Cognizant Matter\". The project's innovative approach to material intelligence directly responds to this call by seeking to  create materials that process information and make decisions autonomously.\n\n**1.3 Vision and Measurable Impacts:** The project envisions creating a new class of materials called \"cognizant metamaterials\" that possess embedded cognitive functionalities.  The measurable impact will be demonstrated through:\n\n*  **Proof-of-concept prototypes**:  Fabricating microfluidic devices incorporating active liquid crystal metamaterials with embedded memory and rudimentary learning capabilities. \n*  **Novel theoretical framework:**  Developing a theoretical framework linking topological defects in active liquid crystals to  information processing and memory functionalities.\n* **Dissemination of results:** Publishing high-impact scientific publications in top-tier journals like *Nature* or *Science* and presenting the results at international conferences.\n* **Potential for novel applications**:  Exploring the potential for applications in soft robotics, bio-inspired materials, and adaptive sensing systems.\n\n**1.4 Contribution to EU Policy Priorities:** \n\n* **Green Deal:** By exploring energy-efficient, bio-inspired design principles, the project aligns with the EU Green Deal’s objective of promoting sustainable technologies.\n* **Digital Transformation:**  The project contributes to the EU’s digital agenda by developing fundamentally new paradigms for computation and information processing within materials, potentially leading to breakthroughs in areas like distributed sensing and edge computing.\n\n**1.5 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**\n*  **Successful fabrication of active liquid crystal metamaterials** demonstrating controllable topological defects within microfluidic platforms.\n*  **Experimental validation of information storage and retrieval** using topological defect configurations. \n* **Development of a theoretical framework that accurately predicts the emergent cognitive-like behaviours** observed in the metamaterials.\n* **Publications in high-impact scientific journals** and presentations at international conferences. \n* **Demonstrations of potential applications** in relevant areas (soft robotics, sensing).\n\n### 2.
