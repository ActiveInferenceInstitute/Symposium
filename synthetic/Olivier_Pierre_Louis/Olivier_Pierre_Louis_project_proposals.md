* **Pivot:** If unforeseen challenges or more promising avenues emerge during research, the project may pivot its direction while staying within the framework of intelligent soft matter and antimicrobial applications.
* **Termination:** The project may be terminated if it becomes evident that the chosen approaches are not feasible or if the key objectives outlined in the proposal are unattainable, despite efforts to adapt. This decision would be made only after extensive analysis and consultation with the EU funding agency, ensuring transparency throughout the process.
