# Project Proposals: Menachem Stern

## Project Title:  **Neuromorphic Soft Matter for Adaptive Biointerfaces: Deciphering the Brain's Language Through Physically Embodied Neural Networks**

### 1. Project Rationale and Objectives

* **Societal Problem:** Neurological disorders, including epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease, impose a significant burden on individuals and healthcare systems worldwide.  Current treatment options often provide symptom management but fall short of addressing the underlying complexities of neural communication and dysfunction. This project seeks to bridge the gap between human neural networks and artificial systems, enabling a better understanding of the brain and novel therapeutic approaches.

* **Scientific Problem:** Understanding how information is processed and encoded in the brain remains a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Current computational models, while powerful, lack the physical embodiment and complexity inherent to biological neural networks. This limits their ability to capture the nuances of synaptic plasticity, dynamic feedback loops, and emergent behaviors found in the brain.  

* **Technological Problem:**  The development of biocompatible, adaptive interfaces for interacting with neural tissues presents a significant challenge.  Traditional rigid electrodes limit the long-term stability and functionality of neural interfaces due to mechanical mismatch and immune responses. Intelligent soft matter offers a unique opportunity to design materials that seamlessly integrate with delicate neural tissues, facilitating long-term monitoring and modulation of brain activity.

* **EU Call Alignment:** This project directly aligns with the Horizon Europe Health Cluster call for proposals on "Understanding the Brain" and "Advanced Technologies for Health". It specifically addresses the need for innovative approaches to decipher the complexity of brain function and develop novel therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders.

* **Project Vision:** To develop neuromorphic soft materials that act as physically embodied neural networks, enabling a deeper understanding of brain function and opening new frontiers in the treatment of neurological disorders.

* **Measurable Impacts:**
    * **KPI 1:** Design and fabricate neuromorphic soft materials that exhibit functional properties of neural networks, including synaptic plasticity, signal propagation, and learning.  Success will be measured by demonstrating these functionalities in controlled laboratory settings using established electrophysiological and imaging techniques.
    * **KPI 2:** Develop biocompatible and adaptive neural interfaces based on neuromorphic soft materials.  Success will be assessed by achieving long-term stability and functional integration with neural tissues in vivo, demonstrated through chronic implantation studies in animal models.
    * **KPI 3:**  Translate the insights gained from neuromorphic soft matter to develop novel therapeutic strategies for specific neurological disorders. Success will be measured by demonstrating therapeutic efficacy in ameliorating disease symptoms or restoring lost functionalities in pre-clinical animal models.

* **Contribution to EU Policy Priorities:** This project supports the EU's commitment to advancing healthcare and promoting innovation within the European Research Area. It aligns with the European Green Deal by prioritizing biocompatible materials and minimizing environmental impact. The project also contributes to the digital transformation by pushing the boundaries of bio-electronic technologies.

### 2.  State of the Art and Novelty

**Current State of the Art:**

* **Neuroscience:** Understanding of neuronal signaling and network dynamics is rapidly growing, but a complete picture of how information is processed and encoded in the brain remains elusive. Computational models are limited by their lack of physical embodiment.
* **Soft Matter:**  Advanced functional materials are being developed, but the ability to create truly intelligent soft matter capable of mimicking neural function is in its early stages.
* **Neural Interfaces:** Existing neural interfaces based on rigid electrodes have limitations in long-term stability, biocompatibility, and adaptive capabilities.

**Project Novelty:**

* **Physically Embodied Neural Networks:** This project introduces a novel approach by creating physically embodied neural networks based on intelligent soft matter. This moves beyond traditional computational models, allowing for the investigation of neurocomputational principles within a material framework.
* **Bio-inspired Material Design:** The project will leverage biological concepts of neural plasticity and signal transduction to design soft materials that exhibit analogous functionalities.
* **Adaptive Biointerfaces:**  The developed materials will be engineered to seamlessly integrate with neural tissues, enabling adaptive, long-term monitoring, and modulation of brain activity.

**Unique Selling Points (USPs):**

* **Novel Material Platform:**  The project introduces a new paradigm of neuromorphic soft matter for investigating brain function.
* **Direct Translational Potential:**  The development of highly biocompatible and adaptive neural interfaces has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of neurological disorders.
* **Interdisciplinary Approach:**  The project combines cutting-edge research in materials science, neuroscience, and engineering to create a new and exciting field of inquiry.

**Cutting-Edge Research:**

* The project represents a unique approach to understanding the brain and developing novel therapeutic interventions.
* It aligns with global research efforts to create bio-inspired, intelligent materials, strengthening the EU's position at the forefront of scientific innovation.

**Chosen Collaborators and Research Domain Field Shift:**

For this project, the ideal collaborators are **Wolfgang Parak**, with his expertise in synthesis and functionalization of quantum dots, and **Rene van Roij**, with his expertise in theoretical modelling of soft matter. Combining the knowledge from both domains will bring a novel solution to problem of mimicking neuron in smart materials. Parak’s work on functionalized nanoparticles and their biocompatibility provides the foundation for creating the “neurons” of our system, while van Roij's expertise in soft matter theory and computational modeling provides the tools for understanding their collective behavior and dynamics.

**Research Domain Field Shift** - Neurons in biological systems are complex entities that exhibit various functionalities related to signal transmission, processing, and modulation. We propose a new concept using functionalized quantum dots (QDs) as artificial neurons within a soft matter matrix to achieve cognitive-like properties, mimicking the basic functionalities of neurons within a material context. By encapsulating tailored QDs with specific light-emitting and light-sensing properties, these artificial neurons will be able to communicate with each other via controlled light signals within the material itself, similar to the electrochemical signaling in biological neuron networks. This will be achieved using the expertise of WP in synthesizing and controlling the QDs’ properties and using RvR’s expertise in developing a theoretical model to control and orchestrate a signal within the polymer network.
