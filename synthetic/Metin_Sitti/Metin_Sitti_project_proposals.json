Project Rationale and Objectives:**\n\n* **Societal Problem:** The project addresses the growing need for energy-efficient and adaptable computing technologies. Current silicon-based approaches have reached their limitations in terms of power consumption and the ability to process complex, dynamic data.  Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the brain, offers a promising alternative but faces challenges in mimicking the adaptability of biological synapses. \n* **Relevance:** This project is highly relevant due to the increasing demands for AI and machine learning, which require ever-more powerful and adaptable computing. Traditional approaches face scaling and energy consumption roadblocks, making bio-inspired solutions crucial.  \n* **EU Call Alignment:** This project aligns perfectly with EU calls focusing on \"Future and Emerging Technologies\" and \"Bio-inspired and Bio-based Industries\" within Horizon Europe due to its innovative approach to creating a new computing paradigm inspired by nature.\n* **Vision:**  To develop a new class of bio-inspired soft matter materials that mimic the synaptic plasticity of the brain, creating a foundation for energy-efficient, adaptable, and potentially self-repairing neuromorphic computing systems.\n* **Objectives:**\n    * Design and synthesize stimuli-responsive microgels with properties that can be modulated by light and chemical signals—analogous to the behavior of biological synapses. \n    * Develop a theoretical framework based on active inference that incorporates the physics of stimuli-responsive microgels to model plasticity and learning.\n    * Fabricate proof-of-concept devices that demonstrate basic computational tasks (e.g., pattern recognition) using microgel arrays. \n* **Contribution to EU Policy:** The project contributes to the EU's Green Deal by promoting energy-efficient alternatives to traditional computing and aligns with the objectives of digital transformation by developing novel computing approaches with the potential for significant economic growth and technological leadership.\n* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**\n    * Successful synthesis of microgels with predictable response to specific stimuli (measured by changes in volume, shape, or conductivity).\n    * Development of a computational model simulating synaptic plasticity and learning using microgel properties with a defined level of accuracy tested on benchmark problems.\n    * Fabrication of a prototype device demonstrating basic pattern recognition tasks with a specific level of performance set as benchmark.\n    * Publication of high-impact scientific articles and filing of patent applications.\n\n**2. State of the Art and Novelty:**\n\n* **Current State of the Art:** Current neuromorphic computing approaches aim to mimic the structure and function of the brain. However, replicating the dynamic and adaptable nature of biological synapses remains challenging. Solid-state memristors show promise but face limitations in terms of biocompatibility and energy consumption.\n* **Gaps Addressed:** This project addresses the gap by focusing on creating synthetic synapses using biocompatible, stimuli-responsive soft materials—microgels. These offer advantages in terms of energy efficiency, biocompatibility, and potential for self-repair.\n* **Novelty:**\n    * **Unique use of stimuli-responsive microgels:** Leveraging the unique dynamic properties of microgels to create a new form of  “soft” synapse that can learn and adapt using minimal energy. The responsiveness of the microgels to specific stimuli allows for controlled changes in morphology, volume, conductivity, and other properties mimicking the adaptive properties of biological synapses.\n    * **Integration of active inference principles:** We'll develop a novel theoretical framework incorporating active inference to control materials and model the internal state of the soft matter,  establishing a link between its physical properties and its learning behavior.\n    * **Field Shift Approach:** The project applies concepts from soft matter physics (stimuli-responsiveness, self-assembly) to the field of neuromorphic computing. By combining these two domains, we aim to create a new class of devices with capabilities not accessible via traditional approaches.\n\n**3.
