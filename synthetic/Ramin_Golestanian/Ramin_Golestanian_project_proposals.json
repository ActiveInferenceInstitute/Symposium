(To be recruited - Ideally should have experience in both materials science and AI/Machine Learning.)\n* **Bioengineer/Synthetic Biologist:** Expertise in integrating biological components into synthetic systems will enhance the project's long-term potential.  Focus will be on incorporating bio-inspired functionalities for sensing or incorporating sustainable biological energy harvesting into the granular networks.  (To be recruited - ideally having experience in biocompatible materials or Bio-MEMS technologies).  \n\n***\n\n  **This project leverages a novel Research Domain Field Shift by applying concepts from  **Neuroscience** (specifically neural network architectures and their ability to process information and adapt) to the domain of **Intelligent Soft Matter**, specifically by implementing these principles into the design of granular flow networks. ** This shifted domain, which we term 'Cognitive Granular Flow Networks (CoG-Flow)' creates a novel solution for developing intelligent infrastructure and robotics.  It offers a unique synergy of adaptive self-healing and potentially energy autonomous systems that is currently not addressed in the scientific literature.   **"
