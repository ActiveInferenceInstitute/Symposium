### 2. State of the Art and Novelty

**2.1 Current State of the Art:** Current intelligent soft matter research is primarily focused on creating materials with individual functionalities (e.g., sensing, actuation, self-healing).  However, integrating these functionalities to achieve autonomous, cognitive-like behavior remains a grand challenge due to the lack of: 

- A robust theoretical framework that quantifies the thermodynamic limits of cognition-like functions in materials.
- Experimental methodologies for constructing materials with distributed decision-making and learning capabilities.

**2.2 Addressing Gaps and Limitations:** This project addresses these limitations by:

-  **Introducing a novel theoretical foundation based on (post)modern thermodynamics and active inference.**  This thermodynamically grounded approach moves beyond equilibrium descriptions of materials and quantifies the energetic costs associated with cognitive processes in soft matter.
-  **Developing a new experimental platform based on active colloidal networks.** This platform utilizes the inherent self-organizing abilities of colloidal particles, combined with stimuli-responsiveness, to achieve distributed sensing and actuation with the potential for embedding machine learning algorithms.

**2.3 Project USPs:**

- **Novel Theoretical Framework**: Quantifying the thermodynamic limits of cognition in materials, providing a fundamental understanding of energy efficiency and performance boundaries.
- **Self-Organizing Colloidal Network Platform:**  Creating a versatile, scalable platform for implementing distributed decision-making and adaptive behavior.
- **Integration of (Post)Modern Thermodynamics and Active Inference:**  Bridging previously disconnected fields (thermodynamics, active inference, soft matter) to create a new approach to AI.
