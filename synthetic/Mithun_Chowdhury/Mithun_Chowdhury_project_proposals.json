His knowledge of QD surface modifications and bioconjugation techniques allows for tailoring these nanoparticles to interact specifically with neural tissues. \n2. **Se-Hyeong Jung (Stimuli-Responsive Polymers):** Jung's specialization in designing stimuli-responsive polymers, particularly hydrogels and microgels that respond to light, is crucial for creating a dynamic and adaptive soft matter matrix. This knowledge ensures that the neural interface can adapt to the complex and dynamic environment of the brain. \n3. **Sayantan Ghosh (Neural Interface Design and Signal Processing):** Ghosh's expertise in brain-computer interfacing (BCI), biomedical signal processing, and bioinformatics is essential for bridging the material science aspects with the neurophysiological aspects of the project. He brings the understanding of neural signals and BCI system design to the collaboration.\n4. **Computational Materials Scientist (Modeling and Optimization):**  An expert in computational modeling of soft matter and machine learning would be critical to optimize the behavior of the  composite materials, predict their response to stimuli, and tailor them for specific BCI applications.  This role can be filled by a researcher whose expertise lies in multiscale modeling techniques, applying artificial neural networks, or material response prediction based on input parameters.\n\n### Research Domain Field Shift:\n\nThis project leverages the concept of **\"molecular recognition and self-assembly\"**, commonly observed in biological systems, and applies it to the design of advanced neural interfaces.  The project will translate this concept, often found in areas like bio-inspired materials and drug delivery, to the field of **neurotechnology**. By mimicking the ability of biomolecules to interact in a specific and controlled manner, this project aims to create a soft material interface that dynamically adapts to neural tissue, improving signal quality and longevity of implanted devices.\n\n###  Project Catechism Aligned with EU Grant Requirements:\n\n## 1. Project Rationale and Objectives\n\n**Problem & Relevance:** Current brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) face significant limitations due to the rigidity of traditional electrodes and the dynamic nature of brain tissue.  This mechanical mismatch leads to inflammation, signal degradation, and a limited lifespan of implanted devices. This project addresses this pressing need by developing a novel generation of adaptive neural interfaces that seamlessly integrate with brain tissue, minimizing trauma, and enhancing the quality and stability of neural communication. \n\nFurthermore, existing BCIs rely heavily on external computational power for signal processing and analysis, hindering the development of truly portable and autonomous neuroprosthetic devices. It is crucial to develop a biocompatible, self-sustaining material interface with inherent bio-inspired computational capabilities for advanced applications.\n\n**EU Call Alignment:**  This project directly aligns with the Horizon Europe Cluster 4:  Digital, Industry and Space, specifically within Destination 6:  \"A human-centred and ethical development of digital and industrial technologies,\" addressing the call for proposals related to \"Next Generation Human-Machine Interfaces\" and \"Advanced Materials for Bioelectronics.\"  This call prioritizes developing novel technologies to improve human-machine interaction and address healthcare challenges, particularly in areas like neuroprosthetics and assistive devices. The need for advanced materials with biocompatible functionalities and the ability to create interfaces between the brain and technology are highlighted in the call. \n\n**Project Vision and Objectives:** Our vision is to **pioneer a new generation of neural interfaces** that  transcend the limitations of current technology. Our objectives are:\n\n*  **Develop a biocompatible, adaptive soft material for neural interfaces** that can dynamically conform to brain tissue, minimizing tissue damage and enhancing signal quality.\n*  **Embed sensory and computational capabilities within this soft material** using functionalized quantum dots and stimuli-responsive polymer networks, moving towards in-situ signal processing.\n* **Validate the material's long-term biocompatibility** and demonstrate enhanced signal stability compared to traditional rigid electrodes.\n* **Create a prototype intelligent neural interface** that utilizes the adaptive material to enhance its performance in a specific BCI application (e.g., movement control for a neuroprosthetic limb). \n* **Establish clear pathways for the translation of this technology** towards clinical applications, ensuring ethical and sustainable practices.\n\n**Contribution to EU Policy Priorities:** This project significantly contributes to the EU's **digital transformation** goals by pushing the boundaries of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and  promoting **social inclusion** by enabling more natural and effective integration of assistive neuro-technologies for individuals with disabilities.\n\n**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**\n\n*  **Successful synthesis of QDs with biocompatible surface ligands** for neural tissue integration. \n*  **Fabrication of a stimuli-responsive polymer matrix** that demonstrates  adaptive conformation to target surfaces.\n*  **Integration of QDs within the polymer matrix** while maintaining their optical properties and biocompatibility.\n*  **Demonstrated enhanced signal quality and reduced tissue damage** in in-vitro and in-vivo models, compared to conventional rigid electrodes. \n*  **Development of a functional BCI prototype** integrating the adaptive neural interface with a specific application.\n\n## 2. State of the Art and Novelty\n\n**Current State of the Art:**  Current BCIs mainly utilize rigid metallic electrodes, largely based on silicon or platinum materials. While substantial progress has been made in signal processing and decoding algorithms, these materials create a significant mechanical mismatch with delicate brain tissue, leading to inflammation, glial scarring, and signal degradation over time. Soft materials, including hydrogels and conductive polymers, are emerging as potential solutions, but these materials often lack the necessary functionality and long-term stability for robust BCI applications.\n\n**Gaps and Challenges Addressed:** This project tackles the following specific challenges:\n\n* **Bio-integration mismatch and tissue trauma:** Existing electrodes often cause inflammation, compromising both the signal recording quality and the long-term functionality of the BCI system.\n* **Limited functionality of soft materials:** Currently available soft materials lack the necessary sophistication and long-term stability for complex BCI operation.\n* **Lack of localized processing & power autonomy:**  Current BCIs rely on external computation, limiting miniaturization and portability.\n\n**Advancements beyond the State of the Art:** \n\n*  **Utilizing biocompatible, adaptive soft material:**  The unique combination of stimuli-responsive polymers with functionalized QDs will create a material capable of dynamically conforming to the brain's complex topography, minimizing tissue damage. \n* **Embedding sensory and computational capabilities directly into the material:** Using  Parak's expertise in QD functionalization, the project will create embedded sensors capable of responding to local changes in brain physiology (e.g., ion concentration, pH changes), effectively moving the preliminary signal analysis to the material itself.\n* **Introducing  bio-inspired information processing:** Learning from nature, we will explore using the arrangement or interaction dynamics of the QDs within the responsive polymer matrix as a means to implement basic computations at the material level. \n\n**Unique Selling Points (USPs):**\n\n* **Truly bio-integrated and adaptive neural interface:**  The material will conform to individual brain structures, significantly improving biocompatibility.\n*  **Potential for self-powered functionality:** We propose to explore incorporating energy-harvesting mechanisms within the materials to reduce dependence on external power sources.\n* **In-situ signal processing via embedded sensors:**  This will enhance signal quality and enable new functionalities for BCIs.\n\n\n**Cutting-Edge Research within EU Framework:**  This project embodies the EU's commitment to advancing neuro-technology by integrating frontier research in nanomaterials, soft matter, and neuroscience.
